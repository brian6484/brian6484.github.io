Let's apply SSL cert on AWS ALB

## Target group
Assign your EC2 instance(s) as target group for the load balancer
to distribute traffic.

Also, HTTPS works *only for domains* like codingmates.com. It *does
not work for pure IP addresses* like 3.18.bla bla.

Domain has to be linked with the IP address of the EC2 server. I
thought domain has to be linked with domain name of the Load Balancer
cuz ALB acts in front of EC2 servers and distributes request.


## Important precaution
We need to enter the cert **key** and **body**.

**Very imporant**: When you copy and paste the key and body,
you MUST include :

```yaml
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----   <- this
bla bla
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----     <- and this

```
These begin and end lines are to be included.
