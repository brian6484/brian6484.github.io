Part 8! Getting more advanced in this sub-section now?

1. Short recap
    * recap of Java Programming I

2. Hash Map
    * HashMap is used when data is stored as key-value pairs, where values can be added, retrieved, and deleted using keys.

    * .put(some key, some value) adds key-value pair to HashMap object

    * .get(some key) gets value of that key, returns null if there is not such key. This method passes key as parameter and returns its value.

    * .values() gets set of values of that key

    * .keySet(some value) gets key of that value 

    * .containsKey(some key) is a boolean method that checks existence of some key

    * Going through Hash map's values using keySet() method (but inefficient):

    ```java
    public ArrayList<Book> getBookByPart(String titlePart) {
        titlePart = sanitizedString(titlePart);

        ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

        for(String bookTitle : this.directory.keySet()) {
            if(!bookTitle.contains(titlePart)) {
                continue;
            }

            // if the key contains the given string
            // we retrieve the value related to it
            // and add it tot the set of books to be returned

            books.add(this.directory.get(bookTitle));
        }

        return books;
    }
    ```

    * Two type parameters are required when creating a hash map - the type of the key and the type of the value added. Like HashMap<String, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

    * The hash map has a **maximum of one value per key**. If a new key-value pair is added to the hash map, but the key has already been associated with some other value stored in the hash map, the **old value is deleted** from the hash map.

    * A Reference Type Variable as a Hash Map Value: 

    ```java
    Book senseAndSensibility = new Book("Sense and Sensibility", 1811, "...");
    HashMap<String, Book> directory = new HashMap<>();
    directory.put(senseAndSensibility.getName(), senseAndSensibility);
    // directory.get("Sense and Sensibility").getContent() or some method in object

    Book match = null;
    //or just match=null;
    for (Book book: books) {
        if (book.getName().equals("Sense and Sensibility") {
            match = book;
            break;
        }
    }
    ```

    * The difference in performance is due to the fact that when a book is searched for in a list, the worst-case scenario involves going through all the books in the list. In a hash map, it isn't necessary to check all of the books as the key determines the location of a given book in a hash map.

    * Limitations of HashMap are that although they work well when we know exactly what we are looking for but if we wanted to identify books whose title contains a particular string, the hash map cannot. The hash maps also have no internal order, and it is not possible to search the hash map based on the indexes. The items in a list are in the order they were added to the list.

    * .toLowerCase() creates new string of all letters to lower case

    * .trim() creates new string that removes space at start and end 

    * Library class encapsulating hash map containing books

    ```java
    public class Library {
        private HashMap<String, Book> directory;

        public Library() {
            this.directory = new HashMap<>();
        }

        public void addBook(Book book) {
            String name = sanitizedString(book.getName());

            if (this.directory.containsKey(name)) {
                System.out.println("Book is already in the library!");
            } else {
                directory.put(name, book);
            }
        }

        public Book getBook(String bookTitle) {
            bookTitle = sanitizedString(bookTitle);
            return this.directory.get(bookTitle);
        }

        public void removeBook(String bookTitle) {
            bookTitle = sanitizedString(bookTitle);

            if (this.directory.containsKey(bookTitle)) {
                this.directory.remove(bookTitle);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Book was not found, cannot be removed!");
            }
        }

        public static String sanitizedString(String string) {
            if (string == null) {
                return "";
            }

            string = string.toLowerCase();
            return string.trim();
        }
    }
    ```

    * 


    * A constructor can be called from another constructor using the **this** keyword, which refers to this object.  this() is used for calling the default constructor from parameterised constructor.
    
    ```java
    public Product(String name, String location, int weight) {
        this.name = name;
        this.location = location;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
    
    public Product(String name){
        this(name,"shelf",1);
    }
    public Product(String name, String location){
        this(name,location,1);
    }
    public Product(String name, int weight){
        this(name,"shelf",weight);
    }
    ```

    * The first constructor does not do anything by itself, but instead calls the second constructor and asks it to set the age to 0. **this(name, 0)** means that call is automatically replaced with "copy-paste" of the second constructor in such a way that the age parameter is set to 0. Also, if a constructor calls another constructor, the constructor call, this(), **must be the first command** in the constructor. But order of constructors don't matter like second constructor can be before first and vice versa.

    * Method overloading in same way as constructor overloading: Once again, the parameters of the different versions must be different.

    ```java
    public void growOlder() {
        this.growOlder(1);
        //same as below code, u can do either
        //this.age = this.age + 1;
    }

    public void growOlder(int years) {
        this.age = this.age + years;
    }
    ``` 

    * OverloadedCounter exercise:

    ```java
    public class Counter {
        private int startValue;
        
        public Counter(int startValue){
            this.startValue= startValue;
        }
        public Counter(){
            this(0);
        }
        public int value(){
            return this.startValue;
        }
        public void increase(){
            this.startValue +=1;
        }
        public void decrease(){
            this.startValue -=1;
        }
        public void increase(int increaseBy){
            if(increaseBy>=0){
                this.startValue += increaseBy;
            }

        }
        
        public void decrease(int decreaseBy){
            if(decreaseBy>=0){
                this.startValue -= decreaseBy;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Primitive and reference variables
    * Primitive variable's information is stored as the value of that variable, whereas a reference variable holds a reference to information related to that variable. reference variables are practically always objects in Java.

    * Primitive variable example:

    ```java
    int value = 10;
    System.out.println(value);
    ```java

    * Reference variable example:
    ```java
    public class Name {
        private String name;

        public Name(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    Name luke = new Name("Luke");
    System.out.println(luke);
    //prints Name@4aa298b7
    ```

    * In above example, we create a primitive int variable, and the number 10 is stored as its value. We create a reference variable called luke. A reference to an object is returned by the constructor of the Name class when we call it, and this reference is stored as the value of the variable. 

    * The value of a primitive variable is concrete, whereas the value of a reference variable is a reference. When we attempt to print the value of a reference variable, the output contains the type of the variable and an identifier created for it by Java: the string **Name@4aa298b7** tells us that the given variable is of **type** Name and its **identifier** is 4aa298b7.

    * Java has eight different primitive variables. These are: boolean (a truth value: either true or false), byte (a byte containing 8 bits, between the values -128 and 127), char (a 16-bit value representing a single character), short (a 16-bit value that represents a small integer, between the values -32768 and 32767), int (a 32-bit value that represents a medium-sized integer, between the values -231 and 231-1), long (a 64-bit value that represents a large integer, between values -263 and 263-1), float (a floating-point number that uses 32 bits), and double (a floating-point number that uses 64 bits).

    * Declaring a primitive variable causes the computer to reserve some memory where the value assigned to the variable can be stored. The size of the storage container reserved depends on type of the primitive.

    * The name of the variable tells the memory location where its value is stored. When you assign a value to a primitive variable with an equality sign, the value on the right side is copied to the memory location indicated by the name of the variable. For example, int first = 10 reserves a location called first for the variable, and then copies the value 10 into it. Similarly, int second = first; reserves in memory a location called second for the variable being created and then copies into it the value stored in the location of variable first.

    * The values of variables are also copied whenever they're used in method calls. What this means is that the value of a variable that's passed as a parameter during a method call is not mutated in the calling method by the method called. Remember the stack simulation?

    * Reference variable: Except the above 8 primitive variables, all other variables are reference type. We can also create our own variable types by defining new classes. Any object instanced from a class is a reference variable. E.g.

    ```java
    Name leevi = new Name("Leevi");
    ```

    * Whenever a new variable is declared, its **type must be stated first**. We declare a variable of type Name below. For the program to execute successfully, there must be a Name class available for the program to use.

    * We state the name of the variable as its declared. You can reference the value of the variable later on by its name. Here, the variable name is leevi.

    * new Name("Leevi") => Values can be assigned to variables. Objects are created from classes by calling the class constructor. This constructor defines the values assigned to the instance variables of the object being created. We're assuming in the example below that the class Name has a constructor that takes a string as parameter.

    * The constructor call returns a value that is a reference to the newly-created object. The equality sign (=) tells the program that the value of the right-hand side expression is to be copied as the value of the variable on the left-hand side. The reference to the newly-created object, returned by the constructor call, is copied as the value of the variable leevi. **A variable of type Name is declared, and the value returned by the Name class constructor is copied as its value.**

    * Difference between primitive and reference variables is that primitive variables are immutable while internal state of reference variables can typically be mutated. This is because value of a primitive variable is stored directly in the variable, whereas the value of a reference variable is a reference to the variable's data, i.e., its internal state.

    * Arithmetic operations can be used with primitive variables but these operations do not change the original values of the variables. Arithmetic operations create new values that can be stored in variables as needed. On the contrary, the values of reference variables cannot be changed by these arithmetic expressions.

    * The value of a reference variable — i.e., the reference — points to a location that contains information relating to the given variable. Let's assume that we have a Person class, containing an instance variable 'age'. If we've instantiated a person object from the class, we can access age variable by following the object's reference. The value of this age variable can then be changed.

    * Assigning a value with the equality sign copies the value (possibly of some variable) on the right-hand side and stores it as the value of the left-hand side variable.

    * A similar kind of copying occurs during a method call. Regardless of whether the variable is primitive or reference type, the value passed to the method as an argument is copied for the called method to use. With primitive variables, the value of the variable is conveyed to the method. With reference variables, it's a reference.

    ```java
    public class Person {
        private int year;

        public Person() {
            this.year = 1996;
        }

        public int getYear() {
            return this.year;
        }

        public void setYear(int year) {
            this.year = year;
        }   
    }

    -------------------------------

    public class TimeMachine {
        private Person traveler;
        
        public TimeMachine(Person person) {
            this.traveler = person;
            // per
        }
        
        public void travelInTime(int years) {
            this.traveler.setYear(this.traveler.getYear() + years);
        }
        

    }

    ------------------------

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person lorraine = new Person();
        TimeMachine tardis = new TimeMachine(lorraine);
        tardis.travelInTime(6);
        System.out.println(lorraine.getYear());
        //2002
    }
    ```

    * Revisit Variables and Computer Memory in this last part. I don't get it now lol

4. Objects and references (revisit it is v.useful)
    * Calling a constructor with the command new causes several things to happen. First, space is reserved in the computer memory for storing object variables. Then default or initial values are set to object variables (e.g. an int type variable receives an initial value of 0). Lastly, the source code in the constructor is executed.

    * A constructor call returns a reference to an object. A reference is information about the location of object data.

    * Object as a method parameter: Since objects are reference variables, any type of object can be defined to be a method parameter.

    ```java
    public AmusementParkRide(String name, int lowestHeight) {
        this.name = name;
        this.lowestHeight = lowestHeight;
    }
    ``` 

    * So the method allowedToRide of an AmusementParkRide object is given a Person object as a parameter. Like earlier, the value of the variable — in this case, a reference — is copied for the method to use. The method handles a copied reference, and it calls the getHeight method of the person passed as a parameter.

    * Review HealthStation and CardPayments exercise

    * **Object as object variable** (object containing references to other object) the thing I am struggling with

    * **Abstraction** is to conceptualize the programming code so that each concept has its own clear responsibilities.

    ```java
    public class SimpleDate {
        private int day;
        private int month;
        private int year;

        public SimpleDate(int day, int month, int year) {
            this.day = day;
            this.month = month;
            this.year = year;
        }

        public String toString() {
            return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;
        }

        // used to check if this date object (`this`) is before
        // the date object given as the parameter (`compared`)
        public boolean before(SimpleDate compared) {
            // first compare years
            if (this.year < compared.year) {
                return true;
            }

            if (this.year > compared.year) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    ```

    * Even though the object variables year, month, and day are encapsulated (private) object variables, we can read their values by writing compared.**variableName**. This is because private variable can be accessed from all the methods contained by that class. Notice that the syntax here matches calling some object method. Unlike when calling a method, we refer to a field of an object, so the parentheses that indicate a method call are not written.

    ```java
    public class Person {
        // ...

        public boolean olderThan(Person compared) {
            if (this.birthday.before(compared.getBirthday())) {
                return true;
            }

            return false;

            // or return more directly:
            // return this.birthday.before(compared.getBirthday());
        }
    }
    ```

    * Why we use .equals() to compare strings and cannot use equal sign: With primitive variables such as int, comparing two variables can be done with two equality signs. This is because the value of a primitive variable is stored directly in the "variable's box". The value of reference variables, in contrast, is an address of the object that is referenced; so the "box" contains a reference to the memory location. Using two equality signs compares the equality of the values stored in the "boxes of the variables" — with reference variables, such comparisons would examine the equality of the memory references.

    * .equals() doesnt work really well for strings so need to implement design ourselves if want to compare 2 objects

    ```java
    public class SimpleDate {
        private int day;
        private int month;
        private int year;

        public SimpleDate(int day, int month, int year) {
            this.day = day;
            this.month = month;
            this.year = year;
        }

        public int getDay() {
            return this.day;
        }

        public int getMonth() {
            return this.month;
        }

        public int getYear() {
            return this.year;
        }

        public boolean equals(Object compared) {
            // if the variables are located in the same position, they are equal
            if (this == compared) {
                return true;
            }

            // if the type of the compared object is not SimpleDate, the objects are not equal
            if (!(compared instanceof SimpleDate)) {
                return false;
            }

            // convert the Object type compared object
            // into a SimpleDate type object called comparedSimpleDate
            SimpleDate comparedSimpleDate = (SimpleDate) compared;

            // if the values of the object variables are the same, the objects are equal
            if (this.day == comparedSimpleDate.day &&
                this.month == comparedSimpleDate.month &&
                this.year == comparedSimpleDate.year) {
                return true;
            }
            // or return this.day == comparedSimpleDate.day && this.month == comparedSimpleDate.month && this.year == comparedSimpleDate.year

            // otherwise the objects are not equal
            return false;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return this.day + "." + this.month + "." + this.year;
        }
    }
    ```

    * The equals method is implemented in such a way that it can be used to compare the current object with any other object. The method receives an Object-type object as its single parameter — all objects are Object-type, in addition to their own type. The equals method first compares if the addresses are equal. After this, we examine if the types of the objects are the same. Next, the Object-type object passed as the parameter is converted to the type of the object that is being examined by using a type cast, so that the values of the object variables can be compared. 

    * Object as a method's return value: For example below, factory object could also be used to create and return new Car objects

    ```java
    public class Factory {
        private String make;

        public Factory(String make) {
            this.make = make;
        }

        public Car procuceCar() {
            return new Car(this.make);
        }
    }
    ```

    * **final** keyword means values of these object variables cannot be modified after they have been set in the constructor. The objects of Money class are unchangeable so immutable — if we want to e.g. increase the amount of money, we must create a new object to represent that new amount of money.
