## Question
https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/77885

### First try
I did just like the question example where I incremented each number by 1 
and counted bit difference. This worked for most except 2 test cases which 
I assume is a very long list and thus caused runtime error.

### Improvement
I googled and there is a pattern.

Firstly for even numbers, adding value 1 (the next odd number) is already 
the answer cuz even numbers look like 110 or 100 so adding 1 will just 
increase the least significant bit.

However, for odd numbers, this is when we need to find a pattern. Actually,
we just need to find the rightmost 0 and all the leftmost bits to that 0 
do not matter. If we change that rightmost 0 to 1, we know that new number 
has a bit difference of less than 3 for sure. But we cannot guarantee that 
it would be the smallest number. So we need to change the 1 to the right 
of the rightmost 0 as 0 to ensure it is smallest.

You can do via converting to binary via bin() and converting back to 
int(,2) or you can do really a pure 100% bit like in that link.

```python
def solution(numbers):
    answer=[]
    for num in numbers:
        if num%2==0:
            answer.append(num+1)
        else:
        # slice cuz bin() makes it 0b blabla so want to remove 0b
            y='0'+bin(num)[2:]
            index = y.rfind('0')
            y=list(y)
            y[index]='1'
            y[index+1]='0'
            answer.append(int(''.join(y),2))
            
    return answer
```
