## Question
https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/77885

### Explanation
For 2차원 동전, bitmask iterating through just 1<<rows does not travel all 
the possibilities. 1<<rows is just a single bitmask where leftmost bit is 
1 and to its right is all 0. We should instead do range(1<<rows) which now 
considers all bitmasks with row bits.

Also for this question, do a test case as to whether doing row then col or 
col then row matters (does order matter)? Turns out order doesn't matter 
but let's just do row then col.

```python
def flipColumn(arr, col):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i][col] == 1:
            arr[i][col] = 0
        else:
            arr[i][col] = 1


def solution(begin, target):
    answer = float("inf")
    rows = len(begin)
    cols = len(begin[0])

    # Initialize the flipped matrix with the correct size
    flipped = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

    # Fill the flipped matrix with the flipped values of the begin matrix
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if begin[i][j] == 0:
                flipped[i][j] = 1
            else:
                flipped[i][j] = 0

    for unit in range(1 << rows):
        count = 0
        rowsFlipped = []
        for i in range(rows):
            comp = 1 << i
            if unit & comp:
                rowsFlipped.append(flipped[i][:])
                count += 1
            else:
                rowsFlipped.append(begin[i][:])

        for j in range(cols):
            curCol = []
            targetCol = []
            for i in range(rows):
                curCol.append(rowsFlipped[i][j])
                targetCol.append(target[i][j])

            # 현재 column과 target column이 다르면 뒤집기
            if curCol != targetCol:
                flipColumn(rowsFlipped, j)
                count += 1
        if rowsFlipped == target:
            answer = min(answer, count)
    if answer == float("inf"):
        answer = -1

    return answer
```
