### Explanation
Well, technically it is a stack question but zipping through the list is 
easier. We first set the first progress count with the first element in the
progress list. If we see a value less than this count, we just increment `count`
but when we have a greater value, then we set this original progress count
as this greater value and append our `count` to our answer list. Lastly,
don't forget to reset the `count` to one.

Once we finished iterating, the last `count` need to be appended.
```python
import math

def solution(progresses, speeds):
    count = 0
    
    answer = []
    
    for progress, speed in zip(progresses, speeds):
        hola = 0
        day = math.ceil((100 - progress) / speed)
        
        if day <= count:
            hola += 1
        else:
            count = day
            if hola > 0:
                answer.append(hola)
            hola = 1
    
    answer.append(hola)  # Append the count of the last set
    
    return answer
```
