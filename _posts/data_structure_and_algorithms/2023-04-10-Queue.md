## Queue
### Declare deque
We can declare queue with no initial data, or with a starting position.
```python
queue = deque()
queue = deque([start_index, end_index])
queue = deque(some_list)
```

### .peek() = deque[0]
We peek queue's front-most element via deque[0]. Btw for stack it is [-1].

### popleft()
If using it as a queue, popleft() removes the front-most element. For stack,
it is just pop()

### append((whatever elements in a list))
Unlike list, deque's append is different. In list, we do .append([list of elements])
but in deque, we don't use the square brackets but instead use circular brackets.
If you are adding a tuple like (dx,dy) and an int like cost to deque, we do 
```python
deque.append(((x,y),cost))
```

### !queue.isEmpty() = while(queue)
I kept on using while stack or while queue without knowing what it really meant
but the while loop goes on **as long as** there is something in the queue or
stack.

I tried calculating the day of each progress and if current day is less
than the recorded previous day(count), then we just increment hola, which
I am gonna append it to list when the opposite condition comes.

3 problems:
1) The variable hola was being incremented but not reset to 0 when a new deployment set started. This caused incorrect counting of features deployed on the same day.

2) The condition if day <= count was incorrect. It should be if day > count because if the current day is greater than the previous maximum day (count), it indicates a new set of features will be deployed.

3) The code was missing the handling of the last set of features deployed. It did not append the count of the last set to the answer list.

Biggest mistake is appending hola when hola is 0. 

Wrong initial code:
```python
import math

def solution(progresses, speeds):
    # queue = deque(progresses)
    hola=0
    count=0
    answer = []
    
    for progress,speed in zip(progresses,speeds):
        day = math.ceil((100-progress)/speed)
        if day<=count:
            hola+=1
            count=day
            continue
        else:
            answer.append(hola)
        
    return answer
```

So correct code is
```python
import math

def solution(progresses, speeds):
    count = 0
    hola = 0
    answer = []
    
    for progress, speed in zip(progresses, speeds):
        day = math.ceil((100 - progress) / speed)
        
        if day <= count:
            hola += 1
        else:
            count = day
            if hola > 0:
                answer.append(hola)
            hola = 1
    
    answer.append(hola)  # Append the count of the last set
    
    return answer
```
or
```python
def solution(progresses, speeds):
    count = 0
    hola = 0
    answer = []
    
    for progress, speed in zip(progresses, speeds):
        day = math.ceil((100 - progress) / speed)
        
        if day > count:
            count = day
            if hola > 0:
                answer.append(hola)
                hola = 0
        
        hola += 1
    
    answer.append(hola)  # Append the count of the last set
    
    return answer
```

Or you can append hola right away and edit that element in list like
```python
def solution(progresses, speeds):

    count=0
    answer = []
    
    for progress,speed in zip(progresses,speeds):
        day = math.ceil((100-progress)/speed)
        if day>count:
            count=day
            answer.append(0)

        #   editing last element in list
        answer[-1]+=1
        
    return answer
```

Or you can edit progresses list with increasing day number like diagram here
https://happy-obok.tistory.com/38
Code:
```python
def solution(progresses, speeds):
    #결과를 담을 리스트
    answer = []
    #작업 리스트가 빌 때까지 반복
    while progresses :
        #몇개의 기능이 배포되는지 저장 
        cnt = 0
        #작업 리스트가 남아있고 맨 앞의 작업의 진도가 100인 경우: 기능 배포 변수 증가. 해당 작업과 작업 속도를 리스트에서 제거
        while progresses and progresses[0] >= 100:
            cnt+=1
            progresses.pop(0)
            speeds.pop(0)

        # 작업 리스트의 진도를 증가
        progresses = [progresses[i]+speeds[i] for i in range(len(progresses))]

        #만약 오늘 기능이 배포되었다면 결과리스트에 추가
        if cnt:
            answer.append(cnt)
    
    return answer
```

I always sturggled taking care of the last case not being handled by my logic
My code would have been like
```python
def solution(progresses, speeds):

    answer = []
    time = 0
    count = 0
    
    while len(progresses)> 0:
        if (progresses[0] + time*speeds[0]) >= 100: 
            progresses.pop(0)
            speeds.pop(0)
            count += 1
            
        else:
            if count > 0:
                answer.append(count)
                count = 0
            time += 1
        
    #     taking care of last case
    answer.append(count)
    return answer
```

But I guess the code on top is better cuz it handles last case by placing
variable `count` within the while loop

While my thinking is right, if there are duplicate values of same priority in queue, it
gets whatever that value comes first in the list.

Wrong code
```python
def solution(p, location):
    maxCount = max(p)
    q = p.copy()
    
    while q:
        if q[0]<maxCount:
            q.append(q.pop(0))
        else:
            break
    ori_value = p[location]
    return q.index(ori_value)+1
```

Correct code:
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(p, location):
    maxCount = max(p)
    queue = deque([(v, i+1) for i, v in enumerate(p)])

    count = 1
    while True:
        v, i = queue.popleft()
        if v < maxCount:
            queue.append((v, i))
        else:
            if i == location + 1:
                return count
            count += 1
            maxCount = max(queue)[0]
```

Or you can use `any()` like
```python
def solution(priorities, location):
    queue =  [(i,p) for i,p in enumerate(priorities)]
    answer = 0
    while True:
        cur = queue.pop(0)
        if any(cur[1] < q[1] for q in queue):
            queue.append(cur)
        else:
            answer += 1
            if cur[0] == location:
                return answer
```

oH i misunderstood the question. Once you see a price that is lower
than the current price that is popped off, we only consider that duration.
Even if there is a higher price later on in the queue, we don't consider that.
So we break out of the loop instead of continue. Before we break out of the loop,
we increment count because when time=0, it is considered meeting the condition.
Wrong code:
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(prices):
    queue = deque(prices)
    answer = []
    while queue:
        price = queue.popleft()
        count=0
        for q in queue:
            if q>=price:
                count+=1
            else:
                continue
        answer.append(count)
    return answer
```

You should not continue when exception is occurred. Instead, you should
break out of loop like

correct:
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(prices):
    queue = deque(prices)
    answer = []
    
    while queue:
        price = queue.popleft()
        count = 0
        
        for q in queue:
            if q >= price:
                count += 1
            else:
                count += 1
                break
        
        answer.append(count)
    
    return answer
```

Correct code
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(prices):
    queue = deque(prices)
    answer = []
    while queue:
        price = queue.popleft()
        count=0
        for q in queue:
            count+=1
            if price>q:
                break

        answer.append(count)
    return answer
```

using stack
```python
def solution(prices):
    answer = [0] * len(prices)
    stack = []

    for i in range(len(prices)):
        while stack != [] and stack[-1][1] > prices[i]:
            past_idx, _ = stack.pop()
            answer[past_idx] = i - past_idx

        stack.append([i, prices[i]])

    for i, _ in stack:
        answer[i] = len(prices) - i - 1

    return answer
```

This is the question where you implement the way a human would solve this
problem. You actually create a queue bridge of 0s of length bridge_length. And
append and pop the truck accordingly
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    bridge = [0 for _ in range(bridge_length)]
    queue = deque(bridge)
    waiting = deque(truck_weights)
    time = 0
    bridge_weight=0
    while len(waiting)>0 or bridge_weight>0:
        cur_weight = queue.popleft()
        bridge_weight-=cur_weight
        if waiting and bridge_weight+waiting[0]<=weight:
            bridge_weight+=waiting[0]
            queue.append(waiting[0])
            waiting.popleft()
        else:
            queue.append(0)
        time+=1
        
    return time
```

while  bridge_weight>0: this is very important because as long as there is
a truck in our queue bridge currently passing, it needs to finish crossing
regardless of whether the waiting queue of all trucks is empty.

[Fix 25th June] fuck i keep misunderstanding this if waiting condition.
If waiting means if there is any element left in our waiting queue, not
the other way around where if it is empty.

    pointer1 =0
    pointer2=0
    count =0
    for i in range(len(queue1),len(queue2)):
        sum1 = sum(queue1)
        sum2 = sum(queue2)
        if sum1==sum2:
            return count
        elif sum1<sum2:
            if queue2[pointer2] > queue1[pointer1]:
                queue1.append(queue2[pointer])

we iterate up till 3 times the length of queue1, as explained by that link
```python
from collections import deque
def solution(queue1, queue2):
    answer = 0
    queue1, queue2 = deque(queue1), deque(queue2)
    sum1, sum2 = sum(queue1), sum(queue2)
    for i in range(len(queue1)*3):
        if sum1>sum2:
            sum1-=queue1[0]
            sum2+=queue1[0]
            queue2.append(queue1.popleft())
            answer+=1
        elif sum2>sum1:
            sum2-=queue2[0]
            sum1+=queue2[0]
            queue1.append(queue2.popleft())
            answer+=1
        else:
            return answer
    return -1
