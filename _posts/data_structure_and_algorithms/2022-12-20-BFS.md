## Intro
Use queue for BFS to find **the shortest something** and when weight to travel
nodes is constant like one. Dijkstra is also finding the shortest something
but when weights are not constant for each node.

## Precautions
Btw if input is given like ["X591X","X1X5X","X231X", "1XXX1"] and we should
convert it to 2d graph representation like
```python
def convert_to_graph(lst):
    graph = []
    for row in lst:
        graph.append(list(row))
    return graph

```

Also **really important** for the boundary check of 2x2 graph.

`The problem lies in the condition next_x >= len(graph) when checking the bounds for next_x in the BFS loop. It should be next_x >= len(graph[0]) since the length of each row in graph represents the number of columns.`



## Practice questions
### 그림

My intitial wrong code. As you can see, it is really messy and I dont really
know the exact way to implement BFS. Actually in a simple grid question
like this, instead of creating a separate visited 2d list, you can instead just
mark the board graph itself by making the value 0. We do bfs on grid that is 
1 anyways so when we are doing with bfs, just mark that as 0 and future bfs 
searches will not search that grid anymore. 

```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = []

for i in range(n):
    graph.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

visited= [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
count = 0
area = 0
moves = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]

def bfs(graph,visited,queue):
    area=0
    while queue:
        curr_x,curr_y,curr_area = queue.popleft()
        area = max(area,curr_area)
        for move in moves:
            next_x,next_y = move[0]+curr_x,move[1]+curr_y
            if next_x<0 or next_x>=n or next_y<0 or next_y>=m:
                continue
            if graph[next_x][next_y]==0:
                continue
            if graph[next_x][next_y]==1:
                if not visited[next_x][next_y]:
                    queue.append((next_x,next_y,curr_area+1))
                    visited[next_x][next_y] = True
                    # graph[next_x][next_y]=0
    return area

for i in range(len(graph)):
    for j in range(len(graph[0])):
        if graph[i][j]==1:
            queue = deque()
            queue.append((i,j,1))
            visited[i][j]=True
            # graph[i][j]=0
            hola = bfs(graph,visited,queue)
            area = max(area,hola)
            count+=1

print(count)
print(area)
```

But you can still use visited 2d list anyways like this
Correct code:
```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = []

for i in range(n):
    graph.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

visited = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
count = 0
area = 0
moves = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]


def bfs(graph, visited, a, b):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((a, b))
    visited[a][b] = True
    count = 1

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for move in moves:
            nx = x + move[0]
            ny = y + move[1]
            if nx < 0 or nx >= n or ny < 0 or ny >= m:
                continue
            if graph[nx][ny] == 1 and not visited[nx][ny]:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                count += 1

    return count


paint = []
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if graph[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
            paint.append(bfs(graph, visited, i, j))

if len(paint) == 0:
    print(len(paint))
    print(0)
else:
    print(len(paint))
    print(max(paint))
```

Without a separate 2d list and marking grid as 0:
```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = []

for i in range(n):
    graph.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

count = 0
area = 0
moves = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]


def bfs(graph, a, b):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((a, b))
    graph[a][b] = 0
    count = 1

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for move in moves:
            nx = x + move[0]
            ny = y + move[1]
            if nx < 0 or nx >= n or ny < 0 or ny >= m:
                continue
            if graph[nx][ny] == 1:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                graph[nx][ny] = 0  # Mark the cell as visited by setting it to 0
                count += 1

    return count


paint = []
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if graph[i][j] == 1:
            paint.append(bfs(graph, i, j))

if len(paint) == 0:
    print(len(paint))
    print(0)
else:
    print(len(paint))
    print(max(paint))
```

My STILL WRONG CODE:
```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
graph = []

for i in range(n):
  graph.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

visited= [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
count = 0
area = 0
moves = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]

def bfs(graph,i,j):
  queue = deque()
  queue.append((i,j))
  # omitting this line caused the error!
  visited[i][j]=True
  area = 1
  while queue:
    curr_x,curr_y= queue.popleft()
    for move in moves:
      next_x,next_y = move[0]+curr_x,move[1]+curr_y
      if next_x<0 or next_x>=n or next_y<0 or next_y>=m:
        continue
      # this can be omitted too for simplicity
      # if graph[next_x][next_y]==0:
      #     continue
      if graph[next_x][next_y]==1:
        if not visited[next_x][next_y]:
          queue.append((next_x,next_y))
          visited[next_x][next_y] = True
          area +=1
          # graph[next_x][next_y]=0
  return area

for i in range(len(graph)):
  for j in range(len(graph[0])):
    if graph[i][j]==1 and not visited[i][j]:
      hola = bfs(graph,i,j)
      area = max(area,hola)
      count+=1

print(count)
print(area)
```

Oh!! Turns out i wasnt marking the start of bfs search as visited! So in
my bfs function, at the very starting point, i should have marked it as visited!!
Oops!

### 부대복귀
https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/132266

Let's start with a typical DFS question that picks a starting point and spreads
out in 4 directions grid to search for end point.

```python
from collections import deque
def solution(n, roads, sources, destination):
    # or just graph = defaultdict(list) 
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for road in roads:
        start,end=road
        graph[start].append(end)
        graph[end].append(start)
    answer = []
    for source in sources:
        answer.append(bfs(graph,destination,n,source))
    return answer

def bfs(graph,destination,n,source):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((source,0))
    visited = [False for _ in range(n+1)]
    visited[source]=True
    while queue:
        cur_node,cur_cost = queue.popleft()
        # you dont need this line here, do it when you are appending it to queue
        # visited[cur_node]=True
        if cur_node == destination:
            return cur_cost
        for next_node in graph[cur_node]:
            if not visited[next_node]:
                # do it here 
                visited[next_node]=True
                queue.append((next_node,cur_cost+1))
    return -1
```

My bfs is correct but it has runtime error for some large cases.

So how about instead of calculating distance from starting source to destination,
we do the other way around? My initial code will calculate distance
to destination multiple times if starting sources take the same shortest route
to destination. But if we do vice versa, we just calculate the distance from
destination to starting sources **once**.

Again my wrong code
```python
from collections import deque
def solution(n, roads, sources, destination):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    for road in roads:
        start,end=road
        graph[start].append(end)
        graph[end].append(start)
    distance = [-1 for _ in range(n+1)]
    distance[destination]=0
    ans = bfs(graph,destination,n,distance)
    return [ans[i] for i in sources]
        

def bfs(graph,destination,n,distance):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((destination,0))
    
    while queue:
        cur_node,cur_cost = queue.popleft()
        # u dont need this line, mark it when you are appending it to queue
        # distance[cur_node]=cur_cost
        for next_node in graph[cur_node]:
            if distance[next_node]== -1:
                queue.append((next_node,cur_cost+1))
    #             need this line
                distance[next_node] = cur_cost + 1
    return distance

```

This 1 line makes the difference. I thought you don't have to update distance
of next_node's cost because we do that in the queue via distance[cur_node]=cur_cost.

This question needs BFS search multiple times on the same board itself.
I didn't know how to get the value of BFS search result and if abnormal, append
to answer list. To do this, we can use **flag**. We first set flag as True
or value 1 and when BFS search comes out abnormal, we can set flag as False
based on that BFS search result condition.

Also, it is smart to optimise the movement loop like instead of 
```python
movements = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]
```

We can use a dictionary like 
```python
dic = {0: [0, -1], 1:[-1, 0], 2:[0, 1], 3:[1, 0]}
```

Also be very careful with difference on number 0 and alphabet O. I put it like
if place at dx,dy ='0' but it should have been alphabet O.

My attempt, which is wrong
```python
for i in range(4):
    nx = x + dic[i][0]
    ny = y + dic[i][1]
    nd = d + 1
    # if dx<0 or dy <0 or dx>=5 or dy >=5:
    #     continue
    if 0 <= dx < 5 and 0 <= dy < 5 and not visited[dx][dy]:
        visited[dx][dy]= True
        if place[dx][dy]=='P':
            if dist<=2:
                return 0
        elif place[dx][dy] =='0':
            if dist==1:
                queue.append([dx,dy,dist])
```

Correct
```python
from collections import deque
ans=[]

def bfs(place,pos):
  queue = deque([pos])
  visited = [[False for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]
  dic = {0: [0, -1], 1:[-1, 0], 2:[0, 1], 3:[1, 0]}

  while queue:
    x,y,d = queue.popleft()
    visited[x][y] = True
    for i in range(4):
      dx = x + dic[i][0]
      dy = y + dic[i][1]
      dist = d+1
      if dx<0 or dy <0 or dx>=5 or dy >=5:
        continue
      if not visited[dx][dy]:
        visited[dx][dy]= True
        if place[dx][dy]=='P' and dist<=2:
          return 0
        elif place[dx][dy] =='O' and dist<=1:
          queue.append([dx,dy,dist])
  return 1


def solution(places):
  # global ans
  for place in places:
    flag =1
    for row in range(len(places[0])):
      for col in range(len(places)):
        if place[row][col]=='P':
          val = bfs(place,[row,col,0])
          if val == False:
            flag =0
    ans.append(1 if flag==1 else 0)
  return ans
```

In my queue, the parameters that I store will lead to wrong answer. I store
the previous direction as well

My solution
```python
from collections import deque
def solution(board):
    visited= [[False for _ in range(len(board[0]))] for _ in range(len(board))]
    length = len(board)
    queue = deque()
    # queue.append((0, 0, 0, dir))
    answer=[]

    queue.append((0, 0, 1, 0, 0))
    queue.append((0,0,0,1,0))
    visited[0][0] = True

    while queue:
        moves = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]
        x,y,prevX,prevY, cost = queue.popleft()
        for move in moves:
            dx,dy= x+move[0],y+move[1]
            if dx<0 or dx>=len(board[0]) or dy<0 or dy>=length or board[dx][dy]==1:
                continue
            if dx == len(board[0]) - 1 and dy == length - 1:
                answer.append(cost)

            cost += check_direction(move[0],move[1],prevX,prevY,cost)
            print(cost)

            if not visited[dx][dy]:
                visited[dx][dy]= True
                queue.append((dx,dy,move[0],move[1],cost))
                print((dx,dy,move[0],move[1],cost))

    return min(answer)

def check_direction(nextX,nextY,prevX,prevY,cost):
    if prevX == nextX and prevY==nextY:
        cost+=100
    else:
        cost+=500
    return cost

solution([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]])
```

But this will that when bfs starts on starting point 0,0, we can move both
directions - right and down. So in this case, we use a little trick that marks
a custom direction just for this edge case. We mark the direction as integer 5.

I tried fixing code like this but still didnt work. I think its cuz this
visited is not allowing other paths stored in my queue to explore properly.
Also my cost is mega huge idk why

```python
from collections import deque
def solution(board):
    visited= [[False for _ in range(len(board[0]))] for _ in range(len(board))]
    length = len(board)
    queue = deque()
    answer=[]

    # current x, current y, direction, cost
    queue.append((0, 0, 5, 0))
    visited[0][0] = True

    while queue:
        moves = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]
        x,y,prevDirection, cost = queue.popleft()
        for i in range(len(moves)):
            dx,dy= x+moves[i][0],y+moves[i][1]
            if dx<0 or dx>=len(board[0]) or dy<0 or dy>=length or board[dx][dy]==1:
                continue
            if dx == len(board[0]) - 1 and dy == length - 1:
                answer.append(cost)

            cost += check_direction(i,prevDirection,cost)
            print(cost)

            if not visited[dx][dy]:
                visited[dx][dy]= True
                queue.append((dx,dy,i,cost))
                print((dx,dy,i,cost))

    return min(answer)

def check_direction(currentDirection, prevDirection,cost):
    if prevDirection ==5:
        cost+=100
    elif currentDirection==prevDirection:
        cost+=100
    else:
        cost+=500
    return cost

solution([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]])
```

But official solution is here. We actually dont create a visited list because
other paths stored in queue will not be able to visit the already-visited points
by another path that has been processed earlier. So instead, we allow possibility
that other paths will go back and forth and back and forth because there
is no mark of visited points. But we create a price 2d list that record
the smallest price of any path that visits that point.

Ok my explanation above is wrong (June 11th fix) So even though there is no
visited list, we have this condition that stop unnecessary paths from being
added to our queue. The condition is if the point that we are visiting has
a cost that is recorded and is higher than our current cost to visit it,
we override that value. So if our current cost is higher, that means there
is a path that has lower cost that has been already added to our queue. So,
we don't visit that point and try other path.

Like this:
```python
if nc <= price[nx][ny]:
    price[nx][ny] = nc
    queue.append((nx, ny, nc, i))
```

```python
from collections import deque

dx = [0, 0, 1, -1]
dy = [1, -1, 0, 0]

def bfs(board):
    n = len(board)
    price = [[int(1e9)] * n for _ in range(n)]
    price[0][0] = 0

    queue = deque()
    queue.append((0, 0, 0, 5))  # (시작X, 시작Y, 시작Cost, 시작방향)

    while queue:
        x, y, c, z = queue.popleft()

        if x == n - 1 and y == n - 1:
            continue

        for i in range(4):
            nx = x + dx[i]
            ny = y + dy[i]
            nz = i

            if nx < 0 or nx >= n or ny < 0 or ny >= n:
                continue
            if board[nx][ny] == 1:
                continue
            
            if z==5:
                nc = c + 100

            elif nz == z:
                nc = c + 100
                
            else:
                nc = c + 600

            if nc <= price[nx][ny]:
                price[nx][ny] = nc
                queue.append((nx, ny, nc, i))

    return price[-1][-1]


def solution(board):
    n = len(board)
    answer = bfs(board)
    return answer

            if not visited[next_x][next_y]:
                queue.append(((next_x,next_y),cur_cost+1,flag))
                visited[next_x][next_y]=True

    return -1
```

Instead, you need to do 2 bfs search - 1 from start to lever and 1 from
lever to end point. Another important note is that I don't pass visited
list as parameter to my bfs function because visited list **needs to be 
renewed** for each bfs search. So visited list needs to be freshly instantiated
within the function, not passes as a parameter because we are gonna
reuse it over and over again.

```python
from collections import deque

moves = [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,1]]
def solution(maps):
    #     why is test cas3 -1??
    #     cuz my bfs search marks visited as True for an answerpath that needs to be visited later, but cannot be visited cuz it is already visited
    row = len(maps)
    col = len(maps[0])
    graph = [['1' for _ in range(col)] for _ in range(row)]
    for i in range(len(maps)):
        for j in range(len(maps[0])):
            if maps[i][j]=='S':
                start_pos = (i,j)
            elif maps[i][j]=='L':
                lever_pos = (i,j)
            elif maps[i][j] == 'E':
                end_pos = (i,j)
            graph[i][j]=maps[i][j]


    val1  = bfs(start_pos,lever_pos,graph,maps)
    val2 = bfs(lever_pos,end_pos,graph,maps)
    return val1+val2 if val1>0 and val2>0 else -1

def bfs(start_pos,end_pos,graph,maps):
    row = len(maps)
    col = len(maps[0])
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(((start_pos[0],start_pos[1]),0))
    visited = [[False for _ in range(col)] for _ in range(row)]
    visited[start_pos[0]][start_pos[1]] = True
    while queue:
        cur_pos, cur_cost = queue.popleft()
        cur_x, cur_y = cur_pos[0], cur_pos[1]
        if cur_x == end_pos[0] and cur_y == end_pos[1]:
            return cur_cost
        # if cur_x == lever_pos[0] and cur_y == lever_pos[1]:
        #     flag = True
        for move in moves:
            next_x, next_y = cur_x +move[0], cur_y+move[1]
            if next_x<0 or next_x >=row or next_y <0 or next_y >=col:
                continue
            if graph[next_x][next_y] =='X':
                continue
            if not visited[next_x][next_y]:
                queue.append(((next_x,next_y),cur_cost+1))
                visited[next_x][next_y]=True

    return -1

First, my wrong code. While I was correctly checking for every word in words
list and if there is just one char difference, I add that new_word and
curr_count+1 to my queue. However, my code is going to infinite recursion.
That is strange. I just wanted word in words list that matches this condition
to be added to my queue and that was it.

```python
from collections import deque

def solution(begin, target, words):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((begin, 0))
    count = bfs(queue, target, words)
    print(count)
    return count

def bfs(queue, target, words):
    while queue:
        curr_word, curr_count = queue.popleft()
        if curr_word == target:
            return curr_count
        for word in words:
            match_count = 0
            for i in range(len(word)):
                if word[i] != curr_word[i]:
                    match_count += 1
            if match_count == 1:
                queue.append((word, curr_count + 1))
                 # Remove the visited word from the list to avoid revisiting
                # words.remove(word) 
    return 0
```

But look at my implementation.
```python
for word in words:
```

While I was looping through word in words,
I am not adding a stop condition like a visited list to mark the current
word as "visited". So it goes on an infinite loop on the same word over and over
and over again.

So if we want to avoid revisiting the same node again and again, we can
remove current word from our words list by adding
```python
if match_count == 1:
    queue.append((word, curr_count + 1))
     # Remove the visited word from the list to avoid revisiting
    words.remove(word) 
```

But ideally we do not want to change or modify the input parameter of words
list so we have 2 alternate ways - make visited list or loop through word
**by index**.

First with a visited list
```python
# in your solution as we dont want to instantiate a new one when bfs is executed
# want to keep using this visited list for all queue elements
visited = []  # List to track visited words

# in your bfs 
for word in words:
  if word not in visited:  # Check if the word is not visited
    match_count = 0
    for i in range(len(word)):
      if word[i] != curr_word[i]:
        match_count += 1
    if match_count == 1:
      queue.append((word, curr_count + 1))
      visited.append(word) 
```

Secondly you can really easily loop through like
```python
for i in range(len(words)):
    for i in range(len(words[i]))
```

This ensures that we don't revisit the element in the list again cuz
the index keeps increasing and we get a new word each time.

MY initial code i think does not backtrack like if there are tickets
ICN-AAA, ICN-BBB, BBB-ICN, my route should not finish at ICN-AAA just because
it is lexicogrphically smaller. Instead it should be ICN - BBB - ICN -AAA.

[Fix 28th June] Actually that is not the issue with my code. My code 
does not account for duplicate tickets given as parameter. Continued on
next paragraph

This does not work for duplicate keys
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def solution(tickets):
  graph = defaultdict(list)
  for ticket in tickets:
    graph[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])

  queue = deque()
  ans = []

  queue.append(('ICN', ['ICN'], set()))
  ans.append(bfs(queue, graph, tickets))
  print(sorted(ans)[0])
  return sorted(ans)[0]

def bfs(queue, graph, tickets):
  while queue:
    cur_node, curr_path, used = queue.popleft()
    if len(used) == len(tickets):
      return curr_path
    for next_node in sorted(graph[cur_node]):
      if (cur_node, next_node) not in used:
        next_used = used.copy()
        next_used.add((cur_node, next_node))
        queue.append((next_node, curr_path + [next_node], next_used))
```

Since I am using a set I cannot use a duplicate ticket and store it in my
set as visited.

```python
solution([["ICN", "AAA"], ["ICN", "CCC"], ["CCC", "DDD"], ["AAA", "BBB"], ["AAA", "BBB"], ["DDD", "ICN"], ["BBB", "AAA"]])
# ans should be
["ICN", "CCC", "DDD", "ICN", "AAA", "BBB", "AAA", "BBB"]
```


or you can use stack like
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def solution(tickets):
    ans = []
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    path = []
    for ticket in tickets:
        graph[ticket[0]].append(ticket[1])
    for key in graph.keys():
        graph[key].sort()
    stack = deque()
    stack.append('ICN')
    while stack:
        from_city = stack[-1]
        if from_city not in graph or len(graph[from_city])==0:
            path.append(stack.pop())
        else:
            stack.append(graph[from_city].pop(0))
    
    return path[::-1]
```

previous wrong code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter

def solution(n, edge):
    visited = [False for _ in range(n+1)]
    temp = defaultdict(list)
    
    for start, end in edge:
        temp[start].append(end)
        temp[end].append(start)
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((1, 0))
    
    ans = bfs(queue, visited, temp)
    
    distances = [distance for node, distance in ans]
    counter = Counter(distances)
    highest_distance = max(counter.keys())
    
    return counter[highest_distance]


def bfs(queue, visited, temp):
    ans = []
    
    while queue:
        cur_node, cur_dist = queue.popleft()
        ans.append([cur_node, cur_dist])
        visited[cur_node] = True
        
        for next_node in temp[cur_node]:
            if not visited[next_node]:
                queue.append((next_node, cur_dist + 1))
    
    return ans
```

Oh the error was that I was marking visited node in my while loop 
like visited[cur_node] in my while loop but it should be marked at the 
point when it is added to queue like visited[next_node] = True.

But why? 

It should be marked as visited at the point when it is enqueued 
because when I debugged, if we dont do that then it will marked as 
visited only when it is dequeed. But the problem is that the other paths 
may explore that node which should have been marked as visited but 
hasnt been popped off and thus is wrongly marked as not visited.

So fix that and I got
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque, Counter
def solution(n, edge):
    visited = [False for _ in range(n+1)]
    temp = defaultdict(list)
    
    for start, end in edge:
        temp[start].append(end)
        temp[end].append(start)
    
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((1, 0))
    visited[1]=True
    
    ans = bfs(queue, visited, temp)
    # print(ans)
    
    distances = [distance for node, distance in ans]
    counter = Counter(distances)
    highest_distance = max(counter.keys())

    # print(counter[highest_distance])
    return counter[highest_distance]


def bfs(queue, visited, temp):
    ans = []
    
    while queue:
        cur_node, cur_dist = queue.popleft()
        ans.append([cur_node, cur_dist])
        # visited[cur_node] = True
        
        for next_node in temp[cur_node]:
            if not visited[next_node]:
                queue.append((next_node, cur_dist + 1))
                visited[next_node] = True
    
    return ans
```

ok so 2 things when ur adding to queue, the last marked grid to X might 
be explored in the last element in the queue so i need to check if that 
is x or not and if not we add it to sum. secondly my next x and next y 
range limit was wrong. next_x is not mathematical x it is the row so 
len(graph) 

Also, instead of just marking visited grid as X, a separate visited list will be more helpful because then i wont need as many checks

my initial wrong code:
```python
def solution(maps):
    rows = len(maps)
    cols = len(maps[0])
    graph = []
    for row in maps:
        graph.append(list(row))
    print(graph)
    # visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    moves = [[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,-1]]
    answer = []
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):
        if(graph[i][j]!='X'):
          queue.append((i,j))
          answer.append(bfs(graph,queue,moves))
    print(answer.sort())
    return answer.sort()

def bfs(graph,queue,moves):
    sum=0
    while queue:
      cur_x,cur_y = queue.popleft()
      cur_cost = graph[cur_x][cur_y]
      sum+= int(cur_cost)
      graph[cur_x][cur_y]='X'
      for move in moves:
        next_x=move[0]+cur_x
        next_y=move[1]+cur_y
        if next_x<0 or next_x>=len(graph[0]) or next_y<0 or next_y>=len(graph) or graph[next_x][next_y]=='X':
          continue
        queue.append((next_x,next_y))
    return sum

solution(["X591X","X1X5X","X231X", "1XXX1"])  
```

Then I still have an error like
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(maps):
    rows = len(maps)
    cols = len(maps[0])
    graph = []
    for row in maps:
        graph.append(list(row))
    print(graph)
    # visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    moves = [[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,-1]]
    answer = []
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):
        if(graph[i][j]!='X'):
          queue.append((i,j))
          answer.append(bfs(graph,queue,moves))
    answer.sort()
    # print(answer)
    return answer if len(answer)>0 else [-1]

def bfs(graph,queue,moves):
    sum=0
    while queue:
      cur_x,cur_y = queue.popleft()
      cur_cost = graph[cur_x][cur_y]
      if cur_cost!='X':
        sum+= int(cur_cost)
    graph[cur_x][cur_y]='X'
    for move in moves:
        next_x=move[0]+cur_x
        next_y=move[1]+cur_y
        if next_x<0 or next_x>=len(graph) or next_y<0 or next_y>=len(graph[0]) or graph[next_x][next_y]=='X':
          continue
        queue.append((next_x,next_y))
    return sum

```

The error is that we should only go on with the dfs search if 
cur_cost!='x' so we need to **indent properly**. And also just use 
a separate visited list like

```python
from collections import deque

def solution(maps):
    rows = len(maps)
    cols = len(maps[0])
    graph = []
    for row in maps:
        graph.append(list(row))
    print(graph)
    # visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    moves = [[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,-1]]
    answer = []
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(rows):
      for j in range(cols):
        if(graph[i][j]!='X'):
          queue.append((i,j))
          answer.append(bfs(graph,queue,moves))
    answer.sort()
    # print(answer)
    return answer if len(answer)>0 else [-1]

def bfs(graph,queue,moves):
    sum=0
    while queue:
      cur_x,cur_y = queue.popleft()
      cur_cost = graph[cur_x][cur_y]
      if cur_cost!='X':
        sum+= int(cur_cost)
        graph[cur_x][cur_y]='X'
        for move in moves:
            next_x=move[0]+cur_x
            next_y=move[1]+cur_y
            if next_x<0 or next_x>=len(graph) or next_y<0 or next_y>=len(graph[0]) or graph[next_x][next_y]=='X':
              continue
            queue.append((next_x,next_y))
    return sum
```
