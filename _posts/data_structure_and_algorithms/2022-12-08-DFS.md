## basic DFS with backtracking
Let's say we are given list [1,2,3] and want to create permutation where
order matters so like [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1] , etc.

I had 2 problems.

1) What do I iterate through in my DFS? The index of the list or the actual
number in the list?? The way to mark index or number as visited will differ
so I wasn't sure

2) I struggled with what parameters to pass in for my recursive dfs function. Should I pass
the next index (i+1) for DFS to go to the next index? But what about list
index out of range error? Certainly i+1 goes beyond my list and this error 
will occur!

### Doubts to clear
1) Actually either way is fine! But the way to mark index or number as visited
differs but that is the only difference

With index traversal:
```python
nums = [1,2,3]
visited = [False for _ in range(len(nums))]
ans = []
path =[]

def dfs(nums,path,visited):
    # index traversal
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            ans.append(path.copy())
            return
        if not visited[i]:
            visited[i]=True
            path.append(nums[i])
            dfs(nums,path,visited)
            path.pop()
            visited[i]=False
            
dfs(nums,path,visited)
print(ans)
```

Here, I am accessing the index of nums list and marking the **index** of
visited list as true or false. Don't worry about backtracking yet we go in 
later.

With number traversal:
```python
nums = [1,2,3]
ans = []
path =[]

def dfs(nums,path):
    for num in nums:
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            ans.append(path.copy())
            return
        if num not in path:
            path.append(num)
            dfs(nums,path)
            path.pop()
         
dfs(nums,path)
print(ans)
```

As you can see, we cannot do something like
```python
visited = [False for _ in range(len(nums))]

def dfs(nums,path,visited):
    for i in nums:
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            ans.append(path)
            return
        if not visited[i]:
            visited[i]=True
            path.append(i)
            dfs(nums,path,visited)
            path.pop()
```

because I am accessing my boolean visited array with an actual number, not
the index. So in this case, we cannot use this way of marking number as visited.
Instead, there is a much simpler way - **if num not in list** ! This checks for
any incoming iterated number if it is already present (i.e. visited) in my
path list!

2) Actually, I was confused at the fundamental concept of not visited[index]
or **if num not in list**. We don't need to pass in the next index or value
and frankly we don't need to care because the boolean list or **if num not in list**
automatically checks this for us. 

Let's say we don't put index+1 as parameter for our recursive function. I 
am afraid it will recur back to index and go on infinite loop. Will it actually?

```python
def dfs(nums,path,visited):
    # index traversal
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if len(path) == len(nums):
            ans.append(path.copy())
            return
        if not visited[i]:
            visited[i]=True
            path.append(nums[i])
            dfs(nums,path,visited)
            path.pop()
            visited[i]=False
```
Let's say i=1 and the corresponding number is 2 right. So we mark
visited[1] = True  and append 2 to our path. Then go to dfs(nums,path,visited).
i will go from 0 again. But it WILL NOT go on infinite loop check because 
of our boolean check or **if num not in list**. So i will go to 1 and since
it is already visited, it will go to 2. 

See? We don't need to pass index+1 as parameter.


## Example
Let's take this leetcode question as [example](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)

If we encounter the X sign in 2x2 board, we do a DFS search
on that index.

BTW BFS is used to find SHORTEST distance.


## 2 conditions for DFS
1) Specify the end condition 

If DFS search goes beyond the boundary of the board +
**very important** if we meet an already visited node (for
example in this q, visited node is marked as dot while we
are looking for X)

2) Mark the current,visiting node as visited(true)

Or you will get StackOverflow error, which means recursion is never-
ending.

To make it as visited, we can create a 2x2 boolean array.
But try to mark on the given board itself to save space. For
example, here we can just mark visited node the same way as
the space not occupied by battleship, which is marked by dot.

## DFS template
```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<board.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<board[0].length; j++){
                if(board[i][j]=='X'){
                    dfs(i, j, board);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    private void dfs(int i, int j, char[][] board){
        if(i<0 || i>=board.length || j<0 || j>= board[0].length) return;
        if(board[i][j]=='.') return;
        board[i][j] = '.';
        dfs(i + 1, j, board);
        dfs(i - 1, j, board);
        dfs(i , j+1, board);
        dfs(i , j-1, board);
    }
}
```

## Practice questions
### 네트워크

First the list that is given to us needs to be processed to something like
```python
[[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] 
to graph[i] like graph[0]=[0,1] , graph[1]=[0,1], graph[2]=[2]
```

We can do this like this where if value is 1, there is an edge
connecting the 2 nodes so we add that to the list at graph[i]
```python
matrix = [[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
graph = {}

for i in range(len(matrix)):
    graph[i] = [j for j, value in enumerate(matrix[i]) if value == 1]

print(graph)
```




```python
from collections import defaultdict
def solution(n, computers):
    graph = {}
    for i in range(len(computers)):
        graph[i] = [j for j, value in enumerate(computers[i]) if value == 1]

    print(graph)
    ans = 0
    visited=  [False for _ in range(len(graph))]
    for i in range(len(graph)):
      if not visited[i]:
        dfs(i,visited,graph)
        ans+=1
    # print(ans)
    return ans

def dfs(i,visited,graph):
  visited[i] = True
  for next_node in graph[i]:
    if not visited[next_node]:
      dfs(next_node,visited,graph)
```

### 타겟 넘버
https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/43165
#### DFS first
Initial thinking is like this
```python
def solution(numbers, target):
  answer = 0
  
  dfs(0,0,numbers,target,0)
  print(answer)
  return answer
  
def dfs(index,curr_sum,numbers,target):
  if index==len(numbers) and curr_sum==target:
    answer+=1
  dfs(index+1,curr_sum+1)
  dfs(index+1,curr_sum-1)  
```

But how do you update answer value in python? You need to **pass it to
my dfs function as parameter** for value to be updated.

Ok so let's pass that answer as parameter like this
```python
def solution(numbers, target):
    answer = 0
    dfs(0, 0, numbers, target, 0)
    print(answer)
    return answer

def dfs(index, curr_sum, numbers, target, answer):
    if index == len(numbers) and curr_sum == target:
        answer += 1
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum + numbers[index], numbers, target, answer)
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum - numbers[index], numbers, target, answer)
```


Now we get a index out of range error. But that is strange. I added a condition
to stop recursion when index reaches the len(numbers).

Actually, if you look carefully, my condition does not work properly.
Let's take index = 5 and len(numbers) is also 5. Assuming that curr_sum
is target too, we increment answer. Then, nothing stops the code from going
to the next line and executing those 2 dfs functions that take index+1
as parameter, which goes beyond our list range.

To effectively **stop** those recursive calls once final index is reached,
we need to add a `return` before those dfs calls.

```python
if index == len(numbers):
    if curr_sum == target:
        answer += 1
    return
```

Now all seems fixed right? Until our answer value is still 0. Why?

In python, we have to understand mutable and immutable objects.
Integers like our answer are *immutable* which means its value cannot be
changed once it is declared. Since answer is declared as integer 0, we can't
change that. However, *lists* are mutable so we can update answer value if it
is stored in a list like

```python
def solution(numbers, target):
    answer = [0]  # Use a mutable list to store the answer count

    dfs(0, 0, numbers, target, answer)

    return answer[0]


def dfs(index, curr_sum, numbers, target, answer):
    if index == len(numbers):
        if curr_sum == target:
            answer[0] += 1
        return

    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum + numbers[index], numbers, target, answer)
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum - numbers[index], numbers, target, answer)
```

We can also use `global` keyword like here to modify a global variable inside
and outside our function. In Python, integers are indeed immutable, which means their values cannot be changed once they are created. However, when you use the global keyword inside a function, it allows you to modify the value of a global variable from within that function.

```python
def solution(numbers, target):
    global answer
    answer = 0
    dfs(0, 0, numbers, target)
    print(answer)
    return answer

def dfs(index, curr_sum, numbers, target):
    global answer
    if index == len(numbers):
        if curr_sum == target:
            answer += 1
        return 
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum + numbers[index], numbers, target)
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum - numbers[index], numbers, target)
```

You can also use `nonlocal` like
```python
def solution(numbers, target):
  answer = 0

  def dfs(index, curr_sum):
    nonlocal answer
    if index == len(numbers):
      if curr_sum == target:
        answer += 1
      return
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum + numbers[index])
    dfs(index + 1, curr_sum - numbers[index])

  dfs(0, 0)
  print(answer)
  return answer
```

#### BFS version
Taking note of DFS version, I tried thinking of BFS version

Wrong inital code
```python
def solution(numbers, target):
  queue =deque()
  queue.append((0,0))
  count = bfs(queue,numbers,target)
  print(count)
  return count

def bfs(queue,numbers,target):
  count =0
  while queue:
    curr_index,curr_sum = queue.popleft()
    if curr_index==len(numbers):
      if curr_sum==target:
        count+=1
      break
    queue.append((curr_index+1,curr_sum+numbers[curr_index+1]))
    queue.append((curr_index+1,curr_sum-numbers[curr_index+1]))
```

Again im getting index out of range error. 

Now firstly, we shouldnt be using
break because that means all the elements waiting in our queue will be processed
once we meet that curr_index==len(numbers) condition cuz it breaks out of
the loop completely. Instead, we should use continue to process the other
data waiting in our queue.

Secondly, index out of range error.While we are intercepting well the first parameter 
of queue.append((curr_index+1,curr_sum+numbers[curr_index+1])), the second parameter
is the issue. Why? numbers[curr_index+1]. This surely will go beyond the
length of our nums list.

Finally, we should be returning count in our bfs function because we want that
count value 

So correct solution is 
```python
from collections import deque

def solution(numbers, target):
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((0, 0))
    count = bfs(queue, numbers, target)
    print(count)
    return count

def bfs(queue, numbers, target):
    count = 0
    while queue:
        curr_index, curr_sum = queue.popleft()
        if curr_index == len(numbers):
            if curr_sum == target:
                count += 1
            continue
        queue.append((curr_index+1, curr_sum+numbers[curr_index]))
        queue.append((curr_index+1, curr_sum-numbers[curr_index]))
    return count
```
