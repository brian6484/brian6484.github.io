## Intro
Let's take this leetcode question as [example](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)

If we encounter the X sign in 2x2 board, we do a DFS search
on that index.

BTW BFS is used to find SHORTEST distance.


## 2 conditions for DFS
1) Specify the end condition 

If DFS search goes beyond the boundary of the board +
**very important** if we meet an already visited node (for
example in this q, visited node is marked as dot while we
are looking for X)

2) Mark the current,visiting node as visited(true)

Or you will get StackOverflow error, which means recursion is never-
ending.

To make it as visited, we can create a 2x2 boolean array.
But try to mark on the given board itself to save space. For
example, here we can just mark visited node the same way as
the space not occupied by battleship, which is marked by dot.

## DFS template
```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<board.length; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<board[0].length; j++){
                if(board[i][j]=='X'){
                    dfs(i, j, board);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    private void dfs(int i, int j, char[][] board){
        if(i<0 || i>=board.length || j<0 || j>= board[0].length) return;
        if(board[i][j]=='.') return;
        board[i][j] = '.';
        dfs(i + 1, j, board);
        dfs(i - 1, j, board);
        dfs(i , j+1, board);
        dfs(i , j-1, board);
    }
}
```
