## Read this first
This [visual explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/solutions/1751380/java-c-python-very-very-easy-to-go-solution/?orderBy=most_votes)
explains really well

## Explanation 
So a XOR a becomes 0 because you know 1^1 = 0 (exclusive OR).

So when you want to find the extra character in t that s does not have,
c ^= s, c^= t will rearrange itself to 
c ^= 5^5 ^ 1^1 ^ 2^2 ^4 which XOR with itself gets cancelled out,
leaving that extra character behind.
