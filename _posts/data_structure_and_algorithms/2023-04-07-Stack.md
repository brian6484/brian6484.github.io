## Stack
### Declare stack
We can declare stack with no initial data, or with a starting position.
```python
stack = deque()
stack = deque([start_index, end_index])
stack = deque(some_list)
```

### .peek() = deque[-1]
Normally before you pop it like from a stack, you need to peek at the value.
In Python, we just do deque[-1]

### pop()
If using it as a stack, pop() removes the topmost element stored in the stack
But if you are using it as queue, use popleft()

### append((whatever elements in a list))
Unlike list, deque's append is different. In list, we do .append([list of elements])
but in deque, we don't use the square brackets but instead use circular brackets.
If you are adding a tuple like (dx,dy) and an int like cost to deque, we do 
```python
deque.append(((x,y),cost))
```

### list(stack)
When using deque() in the form of stack and when we want to return that
stack in list form, we simply convert it via *list()*

```python
stack =deque()
return list(stack)
```

### ''.join(stack)
I thought it would be 4324 but no. 
```python
stack = deque([3, 2, 3, 4])
result = ''.join(stack)
print(result)
# 3242
```
