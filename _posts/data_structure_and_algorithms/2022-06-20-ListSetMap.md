## List
* Use when sequence matters
* Collection that knows index position
* can have more than 1 element referencing the same object (list[0]="dog", list[1]="dog)

## Set
* when uniqueness matters
* Collection that do not allow duplicates
* Sets know whether something is already in the collection. You can never
  have more than one element referencing the same object (or more than
  one element referencing two objects that are considered equal - object equality)

## Map
* finding something by key
* Collection that uses key-value pair
* can have two
  keys that reference the same value, but you **cannot have duplicate keys**.
  A key can be any object
