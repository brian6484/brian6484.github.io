## Sorting 정렬
Often we use .sorted(some_array) and a lambda function together.

When used together, sorted() and lambda functions provide a way to define 
custom sorting criteria. The lambda function is used as the *key parameter* 
of sorted() to specify the sorting key for each element in the iterable. 
The key function takes an element as input and returns a value based on 
which the elements are sorted.

## Practice questions

Really easy question. We don't even have to use a lambda function for this question.
But the most up-voted solution is sick

Mine:
```python
def solution(array, commands):
    answer = []
    for command in commands:
        value = sorted(array[command[0]-1:command[1]])[command[2]-1]
        answer.append(value)
    return answer
```

Best code:
```python
def solution(array, commands):
    return list(map(lambda x:sorted(array[x[0]-1:x[1]])[x[2]-1], commands))
```

So `map` applies this lambda function to each element in commands.

This is a question that I tried figuring out how to implement lambda function
to sort this. I tried like

```python
sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: str(x), reverse=True)
```

But while this lexicographically sorts strings in reverse order, I wanted 
34 -> 3 -> 30 but my code gave 34->30->3. I am not getting the biggest
number possible this way so how??

The problem is that digit 3 is short but what if it is extended like 33?
Then my sort will sort the way i want like 34 -> 3(3) -> 30. So we just
multiply the string of digit but how many times? Let's look at the constraint
for number. It is max 999 which means max 3 digits length. So for the smallest digit
of length 1, we should multiply it 3 times to compare equally with the 
number that is length 3. 

For example, 871(871871), 8(88) here 8 comes first because 888 is lexicographically
greater than 871.

I looked at this reference https://jokerldg.github.io/algorithm/2021/05/06/most-big-number.html

```python
def solution(nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: str(x), reverse=True)
    # sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (str(x)[0], -int(str(x)[1]) if len(str(x)) > 1 else int(str(x)[0]) > 0, -x), reverse=True)
#     sort lexicographically by multiplying str(x) 3 times
    # sorted_nums = sorted(nums, key=lambda x: str(x)*3 , reverse=True)
    answer = ''
    return str(int(''.join(str(num) for num in sorted_nums)))
```

Btw we have to convert it to int because of edge case like [0,0,0] where 
if we just return that string form, it would be "000" but the correct answer
is "0". So we convert it to int and back to str.

### H-Index
https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/42747

I had a hard time understanding what H-index is.

```python
def solution(citations):
    # sorted(citations,reverse=True)
    # print(citations)
    citations.sort(reverse=True)
    for index,value in enumerate(citations):
        if index>=value:
            return index
    return len(citations)
        
```

I saw a cool answer like
```python
def solution(citations):
    citations.sort(reverse=True)
    answer = max(map(min, enumerate(citations, start=1)))
    return answer
```

Map applies the min function to pair of index and citation. Enumerate 
associates each citation with an index starting from value 1.
