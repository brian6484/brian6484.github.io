## Approach
1) Remember to ALWAYS set default values as starting points
for our DP iteration (e.g. dp[0]= sth)

## Template
Let's take [this Fibonnaci example](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/solutions/215992/java-solutions/?orderBy=most_votes)

It is good to get the logic first and start from recursive,
then implement memoisation for DP. Lastly, iterative solution
would be the best.

Another example is [house robbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/solutions/156523/from-good-to-great-how-to-approach-most-of-dp-problems/)
