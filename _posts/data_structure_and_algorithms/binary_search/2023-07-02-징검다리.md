## 징검다리

### Explanation
This was my first attempt at binary search on a question that is not as
simple as finding a value in a sorted list.

Binary search is basically guessing the answer value by putting your guess
as mid. If you say mid = 30 seconds, whatever processes need to be completed
within that time. If there is insufficient count due to not enough time, we
do mid = start+1 and else, we do mid = end-1.

```python
def solution(distance, rocks, n):
    rocks.sort()  
    rocks.append(distance)
    start = 0
    end= distance
    answer = 0
    
    while start<=end:
      mid = (start+end)//2
      prev_rock=0
      count = 0
      for rock in rocks:
        if rock-prev_rock <mid:
          count+=1
        else:
          prev_rock = rock
      if count>n:
        end=mid-1
      else:
        start=mid+1
        answer=mid

    print(answer)
    return start-1
```

There are 2 points you need to know. After sorting, we append the distance
value, which is the final end because we are gonna calculate if we can
reach that end from our previous prev_rock position.

The second point that is **really** important is that notice I returned
start -1, not just start. start -1 is essentially mid, where mid is the
minimum value among the distances between stones when n stones are removed.

In the stone example, we return start - 1 because start represents the smallest distance that allows removing n rocks, so the maximum value for the minimum distance would be start - 1.
