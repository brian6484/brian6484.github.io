### Explanation

Remember I said binary search is literally guessing the answer value and 
seeing if all of the logic and condition can be processed within that 
answer value.

Now we are guessing the time for all tasks to be completed and for a given
guess of time, if more tasks than n are completed, we lower the upper boundary
via end = mid -1. Otherwise, we move the lower boundary up via start = mid -1.

But be careful of the limits that the question gave. The waiting time is
huuuge (Donald Trump's yuuge). It can be 1,000,000,000 so set end to accomadate
this. I did `int(10e9)` and I got some test cases wrong because my 
upper boundary is smaller than what the time can be.


My correct solution
```python
def solution(n, times):
    start = 0
    end = int(10e18)

    while start<=end:
        mid = (end+start)//2
        count = sum(mid//time for time in times)
        if count>=n:
            end = mid-1
        else:
            start=mid+1
    return start
```

Notice here we are returning start instead of start-1 unlike our
징검다리. We return start because start represents the smallest 
possible time that allows processing n people, which is what we were 
searching for.
