## String
Generally speaking, 2 pointer method is useful in String questions.

### split()
whatever_string.split() automatically splits this string into a LIST
of substrings based on **whitespace** characters so unlike java, no
need .split(“ “)

### no append() or pop() method in string
We cannot use append() or pop() method in strings because strings in
Python are **immutable** unlike lists. Thus, we can achieve same functionality
via string concatentation (+) and string slicing ([start or end index
of string you want to slice])


For example, if you want to remove the first char of string and append
to the back of the string
```python
# wrong, this is for list
# s.append(s.pop(0))

s = s[1:] + s[-0]
```

### stringHola.isDigit()
checks if string is a number 

### bin() to convert to binary string
```python
s = bin(num)[2:]
```
It converts an integer called num to a binary string using the `bin()` 
function and slices the prefix '0b'. With this method, you don't have to code
everything like 

```python
def convert_to_binary(x):
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % 2
        # not digits.append(remainder) 
        # because digits list will have integers, not string, and they
        # cannot be joined together with join() method at the return step
        digits.append(str(remainder))  # Convert the digit to a string
        x //= 2
    digits.reverse()
    return "".join(digits)
```


## Errors
### TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found
When dealing with a string in integer form like "12145" and you are doing 
some processing with that, you are probably gonna use list.
Make sure that when method expects a sequence of strings, you should pass
g a sequence of strings, not integers.

For example
```python
def convert_to_binary(x):
    digits = []
    while x > 0:
        remainder = x % 2
        # not digits.append(remainder) 
        # because digits list will have integers, not string, and they
        # cannot be joined together with join() method at the return step
        digits.append(str(remainder))  # Convert the digit to a string
        x //= 2
    digits.reverse()
    return "".join(digits)
```
