## String
Generally speaking, 2 pointer method is useful in String questions.

### split()
whatever_string.split() automatically splits this string into a LIST
of substrings based on **whitespace** characters so unlike java, no
need .split(“ “)

### no append() or pop() method in string
We cannot use append() or pop() method in strings because strings in
Python are **immutable** unlike lists. Thus, we can achieve same functionality
via string concatentation (+) and string slicing ([start or end index
of string you want to slice])


For example, if you want to remove the first char of string and append
to the back of the string
```python
# wrong, this is for list
# s.append(s.pop(0))

s = s[1:] + s[-0]
```

### stringHola.isDigit()
checks if string is a number
