## Docker basic commands
```yaml
docker container run -p # opens up publish port where HOST:CONTAINER format

docker container port name_of_container # quick port check

docker container inspect --format "{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}" webhost #check ip address of container, which is different from host. Format does the filter role like grep but is cleaner
```


```bash
# opens up port on my machine
docker container run -p 
```
