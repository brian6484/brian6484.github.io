1. Web Application Server WAS
    * includes Web server functionalites and static resource managing

    * Difference between web server and WAS is web server is mainly for static resource while WAS can have application logic 

    * Servlet does all except business logic

    * Contact switching cost is when CPU switches between its threads to do tasks.

    * WAS takes care of multi-threading so we developers no need care code about multi-threading

    * Client Side Rendering CSR - front-end

    * View Template - generates HTML easily

2. Servlet
    *
