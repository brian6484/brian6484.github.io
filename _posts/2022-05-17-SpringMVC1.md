1. Web Application Server WAS
    * includes Web server functionalites and static resource managing

    * Difference between web server and WAS is web server is mainly for static resource while WAS can have application logic 

    * Servlet does all except business logic

    * Contact switching cost is when CPU switches between its threads to do tasks.

    * WAS takes care of multi-threading so we developers no need care code about multi-threading

    * Server Side Rendering SSR - generates and renders final HTML page and delivers to client

    * Client Side Rendering CSR - front-end

    * View Template - generates HTML easily

2. Servlet
    * In resources -> application.properties -> logging.level.org.apache.coyote.http11=debug  this helps debugging much better but only in developmenmt server, not actual server cuz it will decrease performance

    * Ctrl + O and select service method with lock sign on it for HttpServlet

    * HTTP메소드에서 GET방식은 value=text 형식으로 보내지고 body가 없기 떄문에 Content-Type은 필요없다. HTTP메소드에 POST, PUT처럼 Body에 data를 보낼때 Content-Type이 필요하다. Content-type describes what kind of data is in body for humans to easily understand.

    * request.getParameterNames gets the key(paramName) while request.getParameter(paramName) gets the value of the key

    * Lombok library implements getter and setter automatically. We just need to add @Getter @Setter on top of the class

    * Instead of directly setting the response erro code by resp.setStatus(200); it is better to resp.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK)

3. Servlet, JSP, MVC

    * Declare singleton 

    ```java
    private static final MemberRepository instance = new MemberRepository();
    ```

    * Then, create a **private** constructor to prevent making new instances of it

    ```java
    private MemberRepository() {
    }
    ```

    * Lastly, create method getInstance() that always return this singleton instance 

    ```java
    private static MemberRepository getInstance(){
        return instance;
    }
    ```

    * Once it is singleton, cannot create another instance of it via MemberRepository memberRepository = new MemberRepository(), we should call the already-made single instance via MemberRepository memberRepository = MemberRepository.getInstance()

    * @AfterEach resets whatever test has done to variable after each test for the next test to be done on that variable

    * ol element in HTML lists items with numbers (ordered) like 1,2,3, but ul element lists items with just bullet points (unordered)

    * If status code is grey instead of black, it means it is cached

    * In MVC, Controller(controller logic) is like servlet , View(View logic) is like JSP and Service/Repository does business logic and data 

    * **Very Important** It is the controller that calls the view like

    ```java
    @WebServlet(name="mvcMemberFormServlet",urlPatterns = "/servlet-mvc/members/new-form")
    public class MvcMemberFormServlet extends HttpServlet {
        @Override
        protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
            String viewPath = "/WEB-INF/views/new-form.jsp";
            RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher(viewPath);
            dispatcher.forward(request,response);
        }
    }
    ```

    * In JSP, if action="/save", (절대경로 absolute path, better than relative path) URL is localhost:8080/save but if it is action="save", (상대경로 relative path) it starts from current directory localhost:8080/servlet-mvc/members/save from localhost:8080/servlet-mvc/members/new-form.jsp

    *
