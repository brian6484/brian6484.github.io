1. Web Application Server WAS
    * includes Web server functionalites and static resource managing

    * Difference between web server and WAS is web server is mainly for static resource while WAS can have application logic 

    * Servlet does all except business logic

    * Contact switching cost is when CPU switches between its threads to do tasks.

    * WAS takes care of multi-threading so we developers no need care code about multi-threading

    * Server Side Rendering SSR - generates and renders final HTML page and delivers to client

    * Client Side Rendering CSR - front-end

    * View Template - generates HTML easily

2. Servlet
    * In resources -> application.properties -> logging.level.org.apache.coyote.http11=debug  this helps debugging much better but only in developmenmt server, not actual server cuz it will decrease performance

    * Ctrl + O and select service method with lock sign on it for HttpServlet

    * HTTP메소드에서 GET방식은 value=text 형식으로 보내지고 body가 없기 떄문에 Content-Type은 필요없다. HTTP메소드에 POST, PUT처럼 Body에 data를 보낼때 Content-Type이 필요하다. Content-type describes what kind of data is in body for humans to easily understand.

    * request.getParameterNames gets the key(paramName) while request.getParameter(paramName) gets the value of the key

    *
