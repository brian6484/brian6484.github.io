1. Web Application Server WAS
    * includes Web server functionalites and static resource managing

    * Difference between web server and WAS is web server is mainly for static resource while WAS can have application logic 

    * Servlet does all except business logic

    * Contact switching cost is when CPU switches between its threads to do tasks.

    * WAS takes care of multi-threading so we developers no need care code about multi-threading

    * Server Side Rendering SSR - generates and renders final HTML page and delivers to client

    * Client Side Rendering CSR - front-end

    * View Template - generates HTML easily

2. Servlet
    * In resources -> application.properties -> logging.level.org.apache.coyote.http11=debug  this helps debugging much better but only in developmenmt server, not actual server cuz it will decrease performance

    * Ctrl + O and select service method with lock sign on it for HttpServlet

    * HTTP메소드에서 GET방식은 value=text 형식으로 보내지고 body가 없기 떄문에 Content-Type은 필요없다. HTTP메소드에 POST, PUT처럼 Body에 data를 보낼때 Content-Type이 필요하다. Content-type describes what kind of data is in body for humans to easily understand.

    * request.getParameterNames gets the key(paramName) while request.getParameter(paramName) gets the value of the key

    * Lombok library implements getter and setter automatically. We just need to add @Getter @Setter on top of the class

    * Instead of directly setting the response erro code by resp.setStatus(200); it is better to resp.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK)

3. Servlet, JSP, MVC

    * Declare singleton 

    ```java
    private static final MemberRepository instance = new MemberRepository();
    ```

    * Then, create a **private** constructor to prevent making new instances of it

    ```java
    private MemberRepository() {
    }
    ```

    * Lastly, create method getInstance() that always return this singleton instance 

    ```java
    private static MemberRepository getInstance(){
        return instance;
    }
    ```

    * Once it is singleton, cannot create another instance of it via MemberRepository memberRepository = new MemberRepository(), we should call the already-made single instance via MemberRepository memberRepository = MemberRepository.getInstance()

    * @AfterEach resets whatever test has done to variable after each test for the next test to be done on that variable

    * ol element in HTML lists items with numbers (ordered) like 1,2,3, but ul element lists items with just bullet points (unordered)

    * If status code is grey instead of black, it means it is cached

    * In MVC, Controller(controller logic) is like servlet , View(View logic) is like JSP and Service/Repository does business logic and data 

    * **Very Important** It is the controller that calls the view like

    ```java
    @WebServlet(name="mvcMemberFormServlet",urlPatterns = "/servlet-mvc/members/new-form")
    public class MvcMemberFormServlet extends HttpServlet {
        @Override
        protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
            String viewPath = "/WEB-INF/views/new-form.jsp";
            RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher(viewPath);
            dispatcher.forward(request,response);
        }
    }
    ```

    * In JSP, if action="/save", (절대경로 absolute path, better than relative path) URL is localhost:8080/save but if it is action="save", (상대경로 relative path) it starts from current directory localhost:8080/servlet-mvc/members/save from localhost:8080/servlet-mvc/members/new-form.jsp

    * /WEB-INF restricts external calling, resource under /WEB-INF always goes through Controller and cannot be called externally like going to URL/some-resource.html <- this is not allowed

    * 서블릿을 컨트롤러로 사용하고, JSP를 뷰로 사용해서 MVC 패턴을 적용해보자. Model은 HttpServletRequest 객체를 사용한다. request는 내부에 데이터 저장소를 가지고 있는데, request.setAttribute() , request.getAttribute() 를 사용하면 데이터를 보관하고, 조회할 수 있다.

    * Instead of saving user variables in request.setAttribute(), store them in a model

    * Since handler is object to be flexibly used in v5 MVC pattern, cast it to a different type via (ControllerV3) handler;

    * either @Controller or @Component with @RequestMapping works

    * Instead of @RequestMapping(value="/new-form",method= RequestMethod.GET), do @GetMapping("/new-form")

    * @Controller returns View so cannot directly return string but @RestController returns whatever the method type returns like string and inputs directly into HTTP message. Or use @ResponseBody that puts it straight into HTTP message body

    ```java
    @GetMapping("/mapping/{userId}")
    public String mappingPath(@PathVariable("userId") String data){
        //    public String mappingPath(@PathVariable String userId) <- if variable name is same as @PathVariable
        log.info("mappingPaath userId ={}", data);
        return "ok";
    }
    ```

    * MultiValueMap is when a key gets several values 

    * For @RequestParam(required = false) int age, Integer is object so can be null bunt int cannot be null. SO correct code is @RequestParam(required = false) Integer age. Primitive type (int). Different for @ModelAttribute so search up

    * For @ModelAttribute HelloData helloData, if the object has methods like getUsername(), it has username property.

    * @RequestBody Hellodata hellodata <-cant put your already-made object

    * can add @ResponseBody at the public class level, which adds @ResponseBody for all the classes inside it. ResponseEntity is not affected but there are few tricky exceptions. So just use @RestController, which adds @ResponseBody and @Controlelr together

4. Webpage

    * In multi-thread environment, cannot use HashMap, use ConcurrentHashMap. cannot use long sequence, use automic long? sequence

    * 

    * 2 ways to view static content: either copy absolute path of that html file and google without running server or run server and go to that file location via localhost:etc

    * Only GET and not POST works for viewing static content?

    * @Autowired, which is for Dependency injection, can be omitted if there is only 1 constructor

    * @RequiredArgsConstructor substitutes need to write constructor 

    * for th:action="some_url", the url can be omitted and it is nesured that url method is POST

    * @ModelAttribute("item") Item item automatically adds attribute so no need to add this line model.addAttribute("item", item);

    * If no name is assigned with @ModelAttribute, it automatically takes the class that it is going to create object with and make it lowercase and name it like Item -> item or HelloData -> helloData

    * HTTP session is maintaing user's details until he quits the browser but HTTP request deletes details once that request has been fulfilled

    * th:field= "${item.itemName}" automatates declaration of id="itemName" name="itemName" so can delete that

    * hidden field to prevent open from coming out null -> input type="hidden" name="_open" value="_on"/

    * LinkedHashMap guarantees 순서 in which stuff go in, unlike HashMap

    * when naming stuff to be called by Thymeleaf, be careful (e.g. "regions" instead of "region")

    * th:object="${item}" so th:field="*{regions} means item.regions. This th:object can be very far away in form tag and asterisk * can **only be used** if there is th:object

    * no hidden field needed for radio button, unlike checkbox

    * Even when invalid field for price/quantity is POSTed for new item, parameter for addItem - @ModelAttribute Item item autoamtically adds model.addAttribute("item",item) so when redirected, we can see item's saved variables

    * no need to add bindingResult to model attribute because it is automatically added to view

    * bindingResult.rejectValue("price","range"); the error message "range" follows range.item.price where bindingResult's object type is item. MessageCodeResolver?

    * WebDataBinder works for that specific controller via boolean supports that checks class

    * @ModelAttribute("item") ItemUpdateForm form <-must name it as "item" because template uses "item" and if it is not renamed manually, model.addAttribute("itemUpdateForm",item) is done instead of model.addAttribute("item",item) so does not render properly unless u change th:object in thymeleaf

    * @RestController automatically adds @ResponseBody so it converts whatever to JSON

    * @ModelAttribute 는 HTTP 요청 파라미터(URL 쿼리 스트링, POST Form)를 다룰 때 사용한다.@RequestBody 는 HTTP Body의 데이터를 객체로 변환할때 사용한다. 주로 API JSON 요청을 다룰 때 사용한다

    ```java
    List<Member> all = findAll();
    for (Member member : all) {
        if(member.getLoginId().equals(loginId)){
            return Optional.of(member);
        }
    }
    return Optional.empty();

    <!-- is same as this stream -->

    return findAll().stream()
        .filter(member -> member.getLoginId().equals(loginId))
        .findFirst();
    
    ```

    * @ModelAttribute("member") Member member <- no need to name it "member" cuz ModelAttribute automatically takes lowercase of Member object but in Thymeleaf, IDE sometimes does not detect it so name like this for now

    * Another example:

    ```java
    public Member login(String loginId, String password){
        Optional<Member> findMemberOptional = memberRepository.findByLoginId(loginId);
        Member member = findMemberOptional.get();
        if(member.getPassword().equals(password)){
            return member;
        } else {
            return null;
        }

        
        return memberRepository.findByLoginId(loginId).
                filter(m -> m.getPassword().equals(password))
                .orElse(null);
    ```

    * If no time info ias added to cookie, that cookie becomes session cookie which disappears upon browser exit

    * When there are multiple requests at same time, use **ConcurrentHashMap**

    * request.getCookies are returned as an array so Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();

    * For @RequestMapping, we use HandlerMethod but for static resource, use ResourceHttpRequestHandler

    * log.error does not need "{}", just " whatever message"

    * Interceptor cannot set dispatcher type like filter but can include path route in excludePathPatterns 

    * use ObjectMapper to convert to JSON for ModelAndView

    * server.error.include-message=always to customise error messages

    * for @ModelAttribute Form form, no need to model.addAttribute cuz automatically added (check this again but it is true)
