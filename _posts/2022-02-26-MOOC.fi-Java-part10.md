Part 10 stream 

1. Handling collections as streams
    * Stream is a way of going through a collection of data such that the programmer determines the operation to be performed on each value. No record is kept of the index or the variable being processed at any given time. like lambda

    ```java
    long numbersDivisibleByThree = inputs.stream()
        .mapToInt(s -> Integer.valueOf(s))
        .filter(number -> number % 3 == 0)
        .count();
    ```

    * A stream can be formed from any object that implements the **Collection** interface (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, ...) with the stream() method. The string values ​​are then converted ("mapped") to integer form using the stream's mapToInt(value -> conversion) method. The conversion is implemented by the valueOf method of the Integer class, which we've used in the past. We then use the filter (value -> filter condition) method to filter out only those numbers that are divisible by three for further processing. Finally, we call the stream's count() method, which counts the number of elements in the stream and returns it as a long type variable.

    * Lambda expression: Stream values ​​are handled by methods related to streams. Methods that handle values ​​get a function as a parameter that determines what is done with each element. What the function does is specific to the method in question. For instance, the filter method used for filtering elements is provided a function which returns the a boolean true or false, depending on whether to keep the value in the stream or not. The mapToInt method used for transformation is, on the other hand, provided a function which converts the value to an integer, and so on.

    * **Functions thats handle stream elements ​​cannot change values ​​of variables outside of the function**. This has to do with how static methods behave - during a method call, there is no access to any variables outside of the method. On the other hand with functions, the values ​​of variables outside the function can be read, assuming that those values of those variables do not change in the program.

    * Stream methods can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) intermediate operations intended for processing elements ​​and (2) terminal operations that end the processing of elements.

    * Intermediate operations return a value that can be further processed - you could, in practice, have an infinite number of intermediate operations chained sequentially (& separated by a dot). E.g. *filter(), mapToInt()*

    * A terminal operation returns a value to be processed, which is formed from, for instance, stream elements. E.g. *average()*

    * 4 terminal operations:

    * .count() counts number of values in a list

    * .forEach() goes through values in list. It defines what is done to each list value and terminated the stream processing. 

    * .collect() gathers the list values ​​into a data structure. The collect method is given as a parameter to the Collectors object to which the stream values ​​are collected - for example, calling *Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new)* creates a new ArrayList object that holds the collected values.

    * .reduce() combines list items. *reduce(*initialState*, (*previous*, *object*) -> *actions on the object*)*

    * Intermediate operations:

    * .map() changes a stream containing person objects into a stream containing first names.

    * .filter()

    * .distinct() returns a stream that only contains unique values

    * Reading files with streams 

2. The Comparable Interface
    * The Comparable interface defines the *compareTo* method used to compare objects. If a class implements the Comparable interface, objects created from that class can be sorted using Java's sorting algorithms.

    * 

    * Implementations of methods defined in the interface must always have public as their visibility attribute.

    * When a class implements an interface, it signs an agreement. The agreement dictates that the class will implement the methods defined by the interface. If those methods are not implemented in the class, the program will not function.

    * The interface defines only the names, parameters, and return values ​​of the required methods. The interface, however, does not have a say on the internal implementation of its methods. It is the responsibility of the programmer to define the internal functionality for the methods.

    * 

    * .put(some key, some value) adds key-value pair to HashMap object

    * .get(some key) gets value of that key, returns null if there is not such key. This method passes key as parameter and returns its value.

    * .values() gets set of values of that key

    ```java
    public ArrayList<Book> getBookByPart(String titlePart) {
        titlePart = sanitizedString(titlePart);

        ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

        for(Book book : this.directory.values()) {
            if(!book.getName().contains(titlePart)) {
                continue;
            }

            books.add(book);
        }

        return books;
    }
    ```

    * .keySet(some value) gets key of that value 

    * .containsKey(some key) is a boolean method that checks existence of some key

    * Going through Hash map's values using keySet() method (but inefficient):

    ```java
    public ArrayList<Book> getBookByPart(String titlePart) {
        titlePart = sanitizedString(titlePart);

        ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

        for(String bookTitle : this.directory.keySet()) {
            if(!bookTitle.contains(titlePart)) {
                continue;
            }

            // if the key contains the given string
            // we retrieve the value related to it
            // and add it tot the set of books to be returned

            books.add(this.directory.get(bookTitle));
        }

        return books;
    }
    ```

    * Two type parameters are required when creating a hash map - the type of the key and the type of the value added. Like HashMap<String, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();

    * The hash map has a **maximum of one value per key**. If a new key-value pair is added to the hash map, but the key has already been associated with some other value stored in the hash map, the **old value is deleted** from the hash map.

    * A Reference Type Variable as a Hash Map Value: 

    ```java
    Book senseAndSensibility = new Book("Sense and Sensibility", 1811, "...");
    HashMap<String, Book> directory = new HashMap<>();
    directory.put(senseAndSensibility.getName(), senseAndSensibility);
    // directory.get("Sense and Sensibility").getContent() or some method in object

    Book match = null;
    //or just match=null;
    for (Book book: books) {
        if (book.getName().equals("Sense and Sensibility") {
            match = book;
            break;
        }
    }
    ```

    * The difference in performance is due to the fact that when a book is searched for in a list, the worst-case scenario involves going through all the books in the list. In a hash map, it isn't necessary to check all of the books as the key determines the location of a given book in a hash map.

    * Limitations of HashMap are that although they work well when we know exactly what we are looking for but if we wanted to identify books whose title contains a particular string, the hash map cannot. The hash maps also have no internal order, and it is not possible to search the hash map based on the indexes. The items in a list are in the order they were added to the list.

    * .toLowerCase() creates new string of all letters to lower case

    * .trim() creates new string that removes space at start and end 

    * Library class encapsulating hash map containing books

    ```java
    public class Library {
        private HashMap<String, Book> directory;

        public Library() {
            this.directory = new HashMap<>();
        }

        public void addBook(Book book) {
            String name = sanitizedString(book.getName());

            if (this.directory.containsKey(name)) {
                System.out.println("Book is already in the library!");
            } else {
                directory.put(name, book);
            }
        }

        public Book getBook(String bookTitle) {
            bookTitle = sanitizedString(bookTitle);
            return this.directory.get(bookTitle);
        }

        public void removeBook(String bookTitle) {
            bookTitle = sanitizedString(bookTitle);

            if (this.directory.containsKey(bookTitle)) {
                this.directory.remove(bookTitle);
            } else {
                System.out.println("Book was not found, cannot be removed!");
            }
        }

        public static String sanitizedString(String string) {
            if (string == null) {
                return "";
            }

            string = string.toLowerCase();
            return string.trim();
        }
    }
    ```

    * A hash map expects that only reference-variables are added to it (in the same way that ArrayList does). Java converts primitive variables to their corresponding reference-types when using any Java's built in data structures (such as ArrayList and HashMap). Although the value 1 can be represented as a value of the primitive int variable, its type should be defined as Integer when using ArrayLists and HashMaps.

    ```java
    HashMap<Integer, String> hashmap = new HashMap<>(); // works
    hashmap.put(1, "Ole!");
    HashMap<int, String> map2 = new HashMap<>(); // doesn't work
    ```

    * A hash map's key and the object to be stored are always reference-type variables. Java converts primitive variables to reference-types automatically as they are added to either a HashMap or an ArrayList. This automatic conversion to a reference-type variable is called **auto-boxing** in Java, i.e. putting something in a box automatically.

    * When performing automatic conversion, ensure that the value to be converted is not null. Or there will be java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException error. 

    * .getOrDefault(some key to be found, if key is not found, return this value normally 0) method of the HashMap searches for the key passed to it as a parameter from the HashMap. If the key is not found, it returns the value of the second parameter passed to it.


3. Similarity of objects
    * .equals() was used to check similarity of strings but can also be used for references. It checks whether the object given as a parameter has the same reference as the object it is being compared to. In other words, the default behaviour checks whether the two objects are the same.

    ```java
    Book bookObject = new Book("Book object", 2000, "...");
    Book anotherBookObject = bookObject;

    if (bookObject.equals(anotherBookObject)) {
        System.out.println("The books are the same");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The books aren't the same");
    }

    // we now create an object with the same content that's nonetheless its own object
    anotherBookObject = new Book("Book object", 2000, "...");

    if (bookObject.equals(anotherBookObject)) {
        System.out.println("The books are the same");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The books aren't the same");
    }
    ```

    * The internal structure of the book objects (i.e., the values of their instance variables ) in the previous example is the same, but only the first comparison prints "The books are the same". This is because the references are the same in the first case, i.e., the object is compared to itself. The second comparison is about two different entities, even though the variables have the same values and thus prints "aren't the same".

    * If we want to compare our own classes using the equals method, then it must be created and defined inside the class. The method created accepts an Object-type reference as a parameter, which can be any object. The comparison first looks at the references. This is followed by checking the parameter object's type with the **instanceof** operation - if the object type does not match the type of our class, the object cannot be the same. We then create a version of the object that is of the same type as our class, after which the object variables are compared against each other.

    ```java
    public boolean equals(Object comparedObject) {
        // if the variables are located in the same place, they're the same
        if (this == comparedObject) {
            return true;
        }

    // if comparedObject is not of type Book, the objects aren't the same
    if (!(comparedObject instanceof Book)) {
            return false;
        }

        // let's convert the object to a Book-olioksi
        Book comparedBook = (Book) comparedObject;

        // if the instance variables of the objects are the same, so are the objects
        if (this.name.equals(comparedBook.name) &&
            this.published == comparedBook.published &&
            this.content.equals(comparedBook.content)) {
            return true;
        }

        // otherwise, the objects aren't the same
        return false;
    }
    ```

    * Similarly for ArrayList:

    ```java
    ArrayList<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();
    Book bookObject = new Book("Book Object", 2000, "...");
    books.add(bookObject);

    if (books.contains(bookObject)) {
        System.out.println("Book Object was found.");
    }

    bookObject = new Book("Book Object", 2000, "...");

    if (!books.contains(bookObject)) {
        System.out.println("Book Object was not found.");
    }
    ```

    * In addition to equals, the hashCode method can also be used for approximate comparison of objects. The method creates from the object a "hash code", i.e, a number, that tells a bit about the object's content. If two objects have the same hash value, they may be equal. On the other hand, if two objects have different hash values, they are certainly unequal.

    * HashMap's internal behavior is based on the fact that key-value pairs are stored in an array of lists based on the key's hash value. Each array index points to a list. The hash value identifies the array index, whereby the list located at the array index is traversed. The value associated with the key will be returned if, and only if, the exact same value is found in the list (equality comparison is done using the equals method). This way, the search only needs to consider a fraction of the keys stored in the hash map.

    * redo notes here and exercises

4. Grouping data using hash maps

    * HashMap can only have 1 value per key. But we sometimes want to assign multiple values to 1 key. Since keys and values ​​in a hash map can be any variable, it is also possible to **use lists as values** in a hash map. You can add more values ​​to a single key by attaching a list to the key.

    ```java
    HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> phoneNumbers = new HashMap<>();
    ```

    * Each key of the hash map now has a list attached to it. Although the new command creates a hash map, the hash map initially does not contain a single list. They need to be created separately as needed as so:

    ```java
    HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> phoneNumbers = new HashMap<>();

    // let's initially attatch an empty list to the name Pekka
    phoneNumbers.put("Pekka", new ArrayList<>());

    // and add a phone number to the list at Pekka
    phoneNumbers.get("Pekka").add("040-12348765");
    // and let's add another phone number
    phoneNumbers.get("Pekka").add("09-111333");

    System.out.println("Pekka's numbers: " + phoneNumbers.get("Pekka"));
    ```
