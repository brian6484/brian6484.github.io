## IntelliJ Shortcut for the cool kids using Windows 
Here are some useful shortcuts.

## Easy and common
### Code completion/Going to next line in the middle of code line
ctrl+ shift + enter

Normally to go to next line in the middle of code, you do right
arrow + enter but use this shortcut above

### See method's parameters
ctrl + p

### Static import completion
alt + enter

For example, hide Assertions by importing it and can use its methods right away instead of Assertions.assertThat

### Making test case
ctrl + shift + t

Click on that class you want to test and use this shortcut instead
of creating package in test folder

### Going back to what you were previously working on
ctrl + e

### Extract variable or method
ctrl + alt + v for variable
ctrl + alt + v for method

### Implementing methods of interface
ctrl + i

### Select methods to override/implement or see what methods are available
ctrl + o

### See where method is declared
ctrl + b or ctrl + mouse left click

### See implementation  of method
ctrl + alt + b

### Refactoring with Lambda
alt + enter

### Choose inline variable
alt + shift + enter

### inline variable (for refactoring)
Ctrl + alt + n 

like int count = something.getCount() , 
return count => return something.getCount();

### Generate things like getter, constructor
alt + insert

### Create public static void main 
psvm 

For System.out.println(variable) use soutv or soutm to print method

### Go to red underlined error
Windows + f2

### copy and paste in 1 command
ctrl + d

### search
shift twice

### See file structure
ctrl + f12

### print parameters automatically in green
/**

### Introduce constant 
ctrl + alt + c

## Renaming
### rename variable when you did copy and paste or class
shift + f6

When we copy test cases or some duplicate code and we just need to change
the variable name from like member1 to member2

works for class too

### rename variable in 1 file
ctrl + r

### rename variable in mutliple files in 1 directory
click on that directory first
ctrl + shift + r
