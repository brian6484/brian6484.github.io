# Difference between for and while loop: 

It is a very fundamental question that I admit I didn't 100% know how to explain. 

A while loop only has the boolean test; it doesn’t have a built-in initialization
or iteration expression. The only way to initalise a counter is **outside** the while loop.
A while loop is *good* when you don’t know how explicitly
many times to loop and just want to keep going while some condition is true.

But if you know how many times to loop (e.g., the length of an array, 7 times,
etc.), a for loop is cleaner.
