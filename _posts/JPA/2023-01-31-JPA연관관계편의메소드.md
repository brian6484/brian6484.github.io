## Intro
fuck I have been so confused with 양방향 mapping, even more so
with the usage of Dtos but here it is

## Explained

What I mean by 연관관계 편의 메소드 is that let's say project and recruitment
shares a @ManyToOne relationship like this

```java
@Entity
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor(access = PROTECTED)
public class Project extends BaseTimeEntity {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "project_id")
    private Long id;

    @JoinColumn(name = "member_id")
    private Long member_id;

    //etc etc

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "project_recr", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    private List<Recruitment> recruitmentList = new ArrayList<>();

    //연관관계 편의 메소드
    public void addRecruitment(Recruitment recruitment){
        if(this.recruitmentList!=null){
            this.recruitmentList.removeIf(r -> r == null || r.getProject_recr() == null);
        }
        recruitmentList.add(recruitment);
        recruitment.setProject_recr(this);
    }
}
```

So for bi-directional JPA relationships, you have to put 연관관계 method,
like this addRecruitment method. 

Let's look at this test case:
```java
    @Test
    public void saveProjectWithDto(){
        //given
        List<RecruitmentDto> recruitmentDtoList = Arrays.asList(
                RecruitmentDto.builder()
                        .recruitmentCount(3)
                        .recruitmentType("backend")
                        .recruitmentStatus("open")
                        .build(),
                RecruitmentDto.builder()
                        .recruitmentCount(1)
                        .recruitmentType("frontend")
                        .recruitmentStatus("open")
                        .build());

        ProjectDto projectDto = ProjectDto.builder()
                .title("test")
                .content("testing")
                .email("random@gmail.com")
                .url("hola.com")
                .recruitmentDtoList(recruitmentDtoList)
                .startDate(LocalDateTime.now())
                .endDate(LocalDateTime.now())
                .build();

        //when
        Project project = Project.toEntity(projectDto);
        List<Recruitment> recruitmentList = Recruitment.toEntityList(recruitmentDtoList);
        recruitmentList.forEach(recruitment -> project.addRecruitment(recruitment));
        Project savedProject = projectRepository.save(project);

        //then
        assertThat(savedProject.getRecruitmentList().get(0).getRecruitmentCount()).isEqualTo(3);
    }
```

So projectDto comes in with the project details and list of recruitment
details like this

When we convert it to project entity, we can see that the recruitment
in recruitmentList is not being mapped to the project field (project_recr
is null). 
<img src="/assets/images/posts/jpa/relation/2.png" title="제목" alt="아무거나" width="400"/> 

So we use this addRecruitment method to first remove these recruitment in
recruitmentList where project_recr field is null (through the if statement).
Then, we properly set project field in recruitment and add the 
recruitment back to project entity's recruitmentList. The result is:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/jpa/relation/3.png" title="제목" alt="아무거나" width="400"/> 

Now we see project_recr field is mapped to each recruitment in 
project's recruitmentList.

And when we save the project in our repository, the necessary fields
like id, createdDate and modifiedDate (in BaseTimeEntity superclass)
are automatically filled like this
