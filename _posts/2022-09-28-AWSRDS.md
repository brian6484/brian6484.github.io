I have faced this problem multiple times when setting up AWS RDS. When I tried connecting to 
DB for the first time (via IntelliJ), there was this error:

Fatal Error 3000:0 - No such database found

Solution: Please please please! Make sure to **initialise** database name at the *additional
configuration* section at the end of the set-up page. It is tucked away and you have to 
click and open it up to name your db. If you don't do this, AWS actually does not 
create this DB and they even mention this in that section.

Also, be careful and remember the name of the db you are setting
up. Like hyphens or underscores can mean the difference!
E.g. my_db != my-db
