## Intro
Symbolic link is basically Window's shortcut icon. If you have a file
path or name that is very long, it helps to register that name with
a simple short name.

## How to use
```yaml
ln -s [that long file path or name] [short name u wanna give]
```

## Example
If you need to frequently access this file
~/test/test2/test3/test4/example_documents_of_symbolic_link.txt,
typing all of this is a hassle, even with tab in Linux.

Use symbolic link as solution
```yaml
ln -s ~/test/test2/test3/test4/example_documents_of_symbolic_link.txt bitch
```

Now, just type bitch and it automatically follows the link (inode).

## Additional: Check if it is symbolic link
To check if the format of the file and whether it is symbolic link,
type file + name of your file

```yaml
file [name of your file]
file bitch
```
And it will output "example: symbolic link to '~/test/test2/test3/test4/example_documents_of_symbolic_link.txt''"

## Additional: Run the file
Run the file via ./ + name of your file
```yaml
./[name of file u wanna run]
./[bitch]
```
