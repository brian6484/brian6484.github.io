Part 6

1. Objects on a list and a list as part of an object
    * Objects that contain list

    ```java
    public class Stack {
        private ArrayList<String> hola;
        
        public Stack(){
            this.hola = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        public boolean isEmpty(){
            return this.hola.isEmpty();
        }
        public void add(String value){
            this.hola.add(value);
            
        }
        public ArrayList<String> values(){
            return this.hola;
        }
        public String take(){
            return this.hola.remove(this.hola.size()-1);
        }
    }
    ```

    * Exercises with ArrayList as part of object and ArrayList methods on objects

2. Separating the user interface from program logic
    * Creating class UserInterface:

    ```java
    public class UserInterface {
        private Scanner scanner;

        public UserInterface(Scanner scanner) {
            this.scanner = scanner;
        }

        public void start() {

            while (true) {
                System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
                String word = scanner.nextLine();

                if (*stop condition*) {
                    break;
                }

            }

            System.out.println("You gave the same word twice!");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        UserInterface userInterface = new UserInterface(scanner);
        userInterface.start();
    }
    ```

    * We should separate a distinct concept into a class of its own via **abstraction**, and all the "dirty details" should be **encapsulated** neatly inside an object like class 'WordSet' "encapsulates" an ArrayList.

    ```java
    import java.util.ArrayList;

    public class WordSet {
        private ArrayList<String> words

        public WordSet() {
            this.words = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        public void add(String word) {
            this.words.add(word);
        }

        public boolean contains(String word) {
            return this.words.contains(word);
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    public class UserInterface {
        private WordSet wordSet;
        private Scanner scanner;

        public userInterface(WordSet wordSet, Scanner scanner) {
            this.wordSet = wordSet;
            this.scanner = scanner;
        }

        public void start() {

            while (true) {
                System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
                String word = scanner.nextLine();

                if (this.wordSet.contains(word)) {
                    break;
                }

                this.wordSet.add(word);
            }

            System.out.println("You gave the same word twice!");
        }
    }
    ```

    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        WordSet set = new WordSet();

        UserInterface userInterface = new UserInterface(set, scanner);
        userInterface.start();
    }
    ```

    * Changes made inside the class WordSet don't affect the class UserInterface (as long as names of methods that class user interface uses). This is because the user interface uses WordSet through the methods that it provides (public interfaces)

    * If we want to augment the program to include new functionalities by class Wordset, user interface remains clean because method is implemented in Wordset object.

    * Programming tips: Try to always separate the program into several sub-problems and work on only one sub-problem at a time and do only one thing inside one method.

3. Introduction to testing
    * Verify that all variables you are using are initialized. If they aren't, a NullPointerException error will occur.

    * Passing Test Input to Scanner - instead of manually testing program with input, can automate the passing of input like this: Passing a string to the constructor of the Scanner class replaces input read from the keyboard. As such, the content of the string variable input 'simulates' user input. A line break in the input is marked with \n. Therefore, each part ending in an newline character in a given string input corresponds to one input given to the nextLine() command.

    ```java
    String input = "one\n" + "two\n"  +
                    "three\n" + "four\n" +
                    "five\n" + "one\n"  +
                    "six\n";

    Scanner reader = new Scanner(input);

    ArrayList<String> read = new ArrayList<>();

    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Enter an input: ");
        String line = reader.nextLine();
        if (read.contains(line)) {
            break;
        }

        read.add(line);
    }

    System.out.println("Thank you!");

    if (read.contains("six")) {
        System.out.println("A value that should not have been added to the group was added to it.");
    }
    ```

    * Automated testing method is good but limited in large programs. Unit testing is better. Unit testing refers to the testing of individual components in the source code, such as classes and their provided methods. The writing of tests reveals whether each class and method observes or deviates from the guideline of each method and class having a single, clear responsibility. The more responsibility the method has, the more complex the test. If a large application is written in a single method, writing tests for it becomes very challenging. So if application is broken into clear classes and methods, then writing tests is straightforward.

    * Unit test writing begins by creating a test class, which is created under the Test-Packages folder. When testing the Calculator class, the test class is to be called **CalculatorTest**. The string **Test** at the end of the name tells the programming environment that this is a test class. Without the string Test, the tests in the class will not be executed. 

    * Tests are methods of the test class where each test tests an individual unit. Creating a test method that confirms that the newly created calculator's value is intially 0:

    ```java
    import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
    import org.junit.Test;

    public class CalculatorTest {

        @Test
        public void calculatorInitialValueZero() {
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
            assertEquals(0, calculator.getValue());
        }

        @Test
        public void valueMinusTwoWhenTwoSubstracted() {
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
            calculator.subtract(2);
            assertEquals(-2, calculator.getValue());
        }
    }
    ```

    * In the calculatorInitialValueZero method, calculator object is first created. The assertEquals method provided by the JUnit test framework is then used to check the value. The method is imported from the Assert class with the import Static command, and it's given the expected value as a parameter - 0 in this instance - and the value returned by the calculator. If the values of the assertEquals method values ​​differ, the test will not pass. Each test method should have an "annotation" @ Test. This tells the JUnit test framework that this is an executable test method.

    * Test-driven development: a software development process that's based on constructing a piece of software in small iterations. The first thing a programmer always does is write an automatically-executable test, which tests a single piece of the computer program.

    * TDD 1) Write a test for a functionality 2) Run the test 3) Write functionality that meets the test's requirements 4) Run the test 5) Refactor (clean code while maintaining functionality of program, cleaning is improving readability and dividing program into smaller methods and classes)

    * 

    * 2nd and final way to create array. So apart from calling for new, we can also initialize an array with a block, that contains comma-separated values to be assigned in the array. This works for all the types:

    ```java
    String[] arrayOfStrings = {"Matti L.", "Matti P.", "Matti V."};
    double[] arrayOfFloatingpoints = {1.20, 3.14, 100.0, 0.6666666667};
    ```

    * Assigning a value to a specific spot of an Array works much like assigning a value in a normal variable, but in the Array you must specify the index, i.e. to which spot you want to assign the value. The index is specified in square brackets.

    * find the size of the array through the associated variable length. Note it is not method so .length() doesn't work

    * When you use array as a parameter of a method, the method receives a copy of the reference to the array.

4. Strings
    * Strings can't be compared with with the equals operator ==. Use .equals() method 

    * .split() method returns an array of the resulting sub-parts

    * .contains() method -> Strings have a contains-method, which tells if a string contains another string

    * .chartAt() gets character as specified index of string 

    * Splitting a string always produces an array of strings. So if the text is of fixed format, we can assume the data in a specific index to always be of the a specific type and can use Integer.valueOf() to convert string to number for further calculations like sum 

    * .length() method exists for strings (rmb .length is not a method for array) 

    * revisit last exercise PersonalDetails

    ```java
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.Scanner;

    public class PersonalDetails {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            String longestName ="";
            int sum=0;
            int count=0;
            while(true){
                if(input.equals("")){
                    break;
                }
                String[] parts = input.split(",");
                
                if(parts[0].length()>longestName.length()){
                    longestName=parts[0];
                }
                
                sum += Integer.valueOf(parts[1]);
                count++;
            }
            if (count > 0) {
                System.out.println("Longest name:" + longestName) ;
                System.out.println("Age average: " + (1.0 * sum / count));
            } else {
                System.out.println("No input.");
        }
        }
    }
    ```
