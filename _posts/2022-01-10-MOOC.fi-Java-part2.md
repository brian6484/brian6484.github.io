Continuing the journey to master fundamentals of Java in MOOC.fi Java Programming I Part 2!

1. Recurring problems and patterns to solve them
    * revision from part 1

2. Repeating functionality
    * Remember from part 1 that expression is the thing in parentheses in conditional statement? 

    * Simple example of while (true) if ... break:(breaks out of loop when true expression is false)

    ```java
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Input a number, 0 to quit");
        int command = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
        if (command == 0) {
            break;
        }

        System.out.println("You input " + command);
    }

    System.out.println("Done, thank you!");
    ```
    
    * Continue makes execution of loop go to beginning of that loop. Below example, prints unfit number, insert positive integers

    ```java
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Insert positive integers");
        int number = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());

        if (number <= 0) {
            System.out.println("Unfit number! Try again.");
            continue;
        }

        System.out.println("Your input was " + number);
    }
    ```

    * If we need to use a variable after a loop, it needs to be declared before the loop. (Obviously, but sometimes we miss it and careless mistakes happen) 

3. More loops
    * Good while loop structure:

    ```java
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Create variables needed for the loop

    while (true) {
        // read input

        // end the loop -- break

        // check for invalid input -- continue

        // handle valid input
    }

    // functionality to execute after the loop ends
    ```

4. Methods and dividing the program into smaller parts (useful to run code simulation for this part)
    * A method is a named set consisting of statements that can be called from elsewhere in the program code by its name. It can be custom-made or pre-made by respective languages.

    * Methods are written **outside of the curly braces of the main**, yet inside out the "outermost" curly braces. They can be declared below or above main.

    * Order of code execution: When the encountered statement is a method call, the execution of the program moves **inside the method**. The statements of the method are executed one at a time from top to bottom. After this, the execution returns to the place where the method call occured, and then proceeds to the next statement in the program.

    * The main program (main) itself is a method. When the program starts, the operating system calls main. The main method is the starting point for the program, since the execution begins from its first line. The execution of a program ends at the end of the main method.

    * Naming method follows camelCase like public static void thisMethodSaysWoof()

    * **Parameters** are values given to a method that can be used in its execution in parentheses like public static void divisibleByThreeInRange(int beginning, int end)

    ```java
    public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 1;
        System.out.println("The value of the number in the main program: " + number);
        incrementByThree(number);
        System.out.println("The value of the number in the main program: " + number);
    }
    
    public static void incrementByThree(int number) {
        System.out.println("The value of the number in the  method: " + number);
        number = number + 3;
        System.out.println("The value of the number in the  method: " + number);
    }
    }
    // The value of the number in the main program: 1, The value of the number in the  method: 1, The value of the number in the  method: 4, The value of the number in the main program: 1
    ```

    * The variable living in the main program is different from the variable of the method, even if they have same name. This is because The parameter number is copied for the method's use, i.e., a new variable called number is created for incrementByThree method, to which the value of the variablenumber in the main program is copied during the method call. The variable number inside the method incrementByThree exists only for the duration of the method's execution and has no relation to the variable of the same name in the main program.

    * keyword **void** means method returns nothing while **static** returns something. If we want the method to return a value, the keyword must be replaced with the type of the return variable like int or double like public static int. For example:

    ```java

    ```

    * When execution inside a method reaches the command return, the execution of that method ends and the value is returned to the calling method. The lines of source code following the command return are never executed.

    * 


5. Calculating with numbers
    * Expression is combination of values that is turned to another value through calculation/evaluation.

    * If one of operands of operation + is a string, the other operand will become a string too. For example, 

    ```java
    System.out.println("Four: " + (2 + 2)); 
    // Four: 4
    System.out.println("But! Twenty-two: " + 2 + 2);
    // But! Twenty-two: 22
    ```

    * If the dividend or divisor (or both!) of the division is a floating point number, the result is a floating point number as well

    * If the dividend or divisor (or both!) of the division is a floating point number, the result is a floating point number as well.

    ```java
    double whenDividendIsFloat = 3.0 / 2;
    System.out.println(whenDividendIsFloat); // prints 1.5
    ```
    * An integer can be converted into a floating point number by placing a type-casting operation (double) before it:

    ```java
    int first = 3;
    int second = 2;

    double result1 = (double) first / second;
    System.out.println(result1); // prints 1.5

    double result2 = first / (double) second;
    System.out.println(result2); // prints 1.5

    double result3 = (double) (first / second);
    System.out.println(result3); // prints 1.0
    {% endhighlight %}
    ```

6. Conditional statements and conditional operation
    * Some terms explained: Conditional statement begins with keyword **if**, followed by parentheses. Expression is placed inside that parentheses, which is evaluated when conditional statement is reached. After that parentheses comes the code block in curly brackets, which is exececuted if expression in parentheses is true.

    ```java
    if (true) {
        System.out.println("This code is unavoidable!");
    ```

    * if, else if (elif in Python), else

    * Cannot compare the equality of strings using two equals signs(==). Use .equals() method like if (input.equals("hola"))

    * if (number >= 5 && number <= 10); if (number < 0 || number > 100); if (!(number > 4)); not-operator(!) in front of parentheses that encases expression 

    * Sometimes, parsing of conditional statement stops at first condition that is true. Solution is to implement the **most demanding condition** first.

    ```java
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

    int number = Integer.valueOf(reader.nextLine());
    // instead of if (number%3==0), implement most demanding condition first to avoid stop of parsing
    if (number % 3 == 0 && number % 5 == 0) {
        System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (number % 3 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Fizz");
    } else if (number % 5 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Buzz");
    } else {
        System.out.println(number);
    }
    ```
