1. Dependency Injection in Spring

 * Various methods like setter method are used in DI. But DI through constructor is most recommended.

 ```java
    public class MemberService {

        private final MemberRepository memberRepository;

        @Autowired
        public MemberService(MemberRepository memberRepository) {
            this.memberRepository = memberRepository;
        }
 ```
 * And then when you want to DI:

 ```java
    public WebConfig(){
        MemberService memberService = new MemberService(bitchMemberRepository);
    }
 ```

  * But a better way is remembering that @Autowired can be omitted if there is **only one constructor** and using Lombok's @AllArgsConstructor:

  ```java
    @AllArgsConstructor
    public class MemberService {

        private final MemberRepository memberRepository;
  ```

  * Best way is using @RequiredArgsConstructor, which creates constructor only for @final or @NonNull field:

  ```java
    @RequiredArgsConstructor
    public class MemberService {

        private final MemberRepository memberRepository;
  ```

  * Another example of DI:
  ```java
    @Repository
    @RequiredArgsConstructor
    public class MemberRepository {

    //    @PersistenceContext
        private final EntityManager em;
  ```

  * which is same as:
  ```java
    @Repository
    public class MemberRepository {

        @Autowired @PersistenceContext
        private final EntityManager em;

        public MemberRepository(EntityManager em){
            this.em = em;
        }
  ```
