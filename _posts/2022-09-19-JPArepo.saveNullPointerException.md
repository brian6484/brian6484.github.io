While I was creating a test case for my JPArepository to save a post 
in my toy project:

```java
    @Autowired
    private ProjectRepository projectRepository;

    @Test
    public void createPost(){
      //given
      projectRepository.save(Project.builder()
          .title("hi")
          .content("testing")
          .build());
      
      //when
      List<Project> projectList = projectRepository.findAll();
    
      //then
      Project project = projectList.get(0);
      assertThat(project.getTitle().equals("hi"));
      assertThat(project.getContent().equals("testing"));
      }
```

At the createPost function, NullPointerException occurred.

Why? My repository has no problem...?

Turns out projectRepository, which has been DIed, is null.

But why is it null?

Because there is no @RunWith annotation. Whenever conducting test
with SpringBootTest, you need to use the SpringRunner class, which
is inherited from JUnit.

So bean is not DIed properly, causing NullPointer error.

## @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
* When JUnit framework conducs test, runs the built-in Runner class
* If you want to use @SpringBootTest annotation, need to use
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class), which inherits JUnit SpringJUnit4ClassRunner class.
* 스프링과 테스트 통합

## @SpringBootTest
* for an integrated test
* Integrates individual 단위 tests into 1 inegrated test
* But it loads all the application's settings so as the app scales,
it becomes slower
* 스프링 부트를 띄우고 테스트 (이거 없으면 @Autowired does not work)

## @Transactional
* 반복 가능한 test 지원
* For each test run, starts transaction and when test finishes,
rolls back the transaction forcefully

## @DataJpaTest
* for JPA test
* When individual 단위 test ends, automatically rolls back the DB
* Uses in-memory DB
* If want to test in the actual DB, add @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) annotation

## Summary

|      Annotation |    Explanation |     Bean |
|----------------:|---------------:|---------:|
| @SpringBootTest |     통합 테스트, 전체 |      Bean 전체    |
|     @WebMvcTest |         단위 테스트, Mvc 테스트 | MVC 관련된 Bean|
|    @DataJpaTest |         단위 테스트, Jpa 테스트 |   JPA 관련 Bean |
| @RestClientTest |          단위 테스트, Rest API 테스트 |     일부 Bean     |
|       @JsonTest |         단위 테스트, Json 테스트 |   일부 Bean |
