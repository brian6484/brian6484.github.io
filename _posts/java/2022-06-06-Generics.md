## Intro
Generics is often used to write *type-safe collections*. This means that compiler
stops you from putting a Dog into a list of Ducks.

Btw, generic means it is specified by user OUTSIDE the class, not
inside the class.

Without generics, the compiler could not care less what you put into a
collection, because all collection implementations hold type Object. You
could put anything like String, Integer, Duck, Pumpkin in any ArrayList without 
generics; it’s like the ArrayList is declared as ArrayList<Object>.

> Without generics, the compiler would happily let you put a Pumpkin into an ArrayList that
was supposed to hold only Cat objects.
> 
> With generics, you can create type-safe collections where more problems are caught at
compile-time instead of runtime.

So all possible exceptions that may occur at runtime are caught at
compile time by restricting instance types stored in the collection class.


## 3 things about generics
1) Creating *instances* of generic class (like ArrayList)

When you make ArrayList, you have to declare the type of objects to be allowed in the
list like new ArrayList<Song>()

```java
new ArrayList<Song>();
```

2) Declare and assign *variables* of generic types
   
How does polymorphism really work with generic types? If you have an
ArrayList<Animal> reference variable, can you assign an
ArrayList<Dog> to it? What about a List<Animal> reference? Can you
assign an ArrayList<Animal> to it?

```java
List<Song> songList = new ArrayList<Song>();
```

3) Declare and invoke *methods* that take generic types

It is similar to point 2. If you have a method that has as a parameter, say, an ArrayList of
Animal objects, what does that really mean? Can you also pass it an
ArrayList of Dog objects? We’ll look at some subtle and tricky
polymorphism issues that are very different from the way you write
methods that take plain old arrays.

```java
void foo(List<Song> list);
x.foo(songList);
```

### How to use generic class (like ArrayList)?
This is point 1 out of 3.
The 2 areas in a generic class that you need to look are
1) class declaration
2) method declaration

"E" is the type used to create instance of ArrayList. You can think it as like
E = Type.

>Think of “E” as a stand-in for “the type of element you want this collection to hold and return.” (E is
for Element.)

So here, ArrayList<Song> means E becomes Song in **any** method or variable declaration
that uses E.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/java/Generics/2_generic.png" title="제목" alt="아무거나" width="400"/>

E is replaced by the **real** type, which is known as **type parameter** that you use
when creating ArrayList instance. That is why add() method for ArrayList won’t let you add anything except objects of a
reference type that’s compatible with the type of “E.” So if you make an
ArrayList<String>, the add() method suddenly becomes add(String o). If
you make the ArrayList of type Dog, suddenly the add() method becomes
add(Dog o).

E or T, anything that is a legal Java identifier.

### How to use generic methods?
This is point 3 out of 3.

A generic method means that the method declaration uses a type parameter
in its signature. We can use type parameters in several ways:

1) Use type parameter defined in class declaration
```java
public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> ... {
    public boolean add (E o)
  }
```
When you declare a type parameter for the class, you can simply use
that type any place that you’d use a real class or interface type. The type
declared in the method argument is essentially replaced with the type
you use when you instantiate the class.

2) Use type parameter *not* defined in class declaration
```java
//here we can say ArrayList<T> bcos we delcared T at the start of method declaration
public <T extends Animal> void takeThing(ArrayList<T list>)
```

If the class itself doesn’t use a type parameter, you can still specify one
for a method, by declaring it in a really unusual (but available) space—
*before the return type*. This method says that T can be “any type of
Animal.

Btw: 
```java
public <T extends Animal> void takeThing(ArrayList<T list>)
//is not the same as 
public void takeThing(ArrayList<Animal> list)
```

The first one, where <T extends Animal> is part of the method declaration,
means that any ArrayList declared of a type that is Animal, or one of
Animal’s subtypes (like Dog or Cat), is legal. So you could invoke the top
method using an ArrayList of dog, cat or animal.

But the one on the bottom, where the method argument is
(ArrayList<Animal> list) means that *only* an ArrayList<Animal> is legal. The first version takes an ArrayList of any type that is a
type of Animal (Animal, Dog, Cat, etc.), the second version takes only an
ArrayList of type Animal. Not ArrayList of dog or cat, but only
ArrayList of animal.

This violates polymorphism bcos we want arraylists containing subclasses of Animal
as method parameters too!

## Generics in Polymorphism (in type-safe Collection objects)
Generics with polymorphism is counter-intuitive.
Let's try polymorphism with a generic type(class inside the <>)

<img src="/assets/images/posts/java/Generics/6_generics.png" title="제목" alt="아무거나" width="400"/>

But will List of animal parameter accept List of dog? NO!
```java
List<Dog> dogs = List.of(new Dog(), new Dog());
takeAnimals(dogs);
//wont compile!
```

The whole point of polymorphism is that anything an Animal can do,
a Dog can do that as well. But what if:

```java
public void takeAnimals(List<Animal> animals){
    animals.add(new Cat());
  }
```

In this method, we added a Cat in a Dogs-ONLY list. So compiler
will not let you take this risk.

> If you declare a method to take List<Animal>, it can take ONLY a List<Animal>, not
List<Dog> or List<Cat>.

## Generics in Polymorphism (in not type-safe arrays)
However, for not type-safe things like arrays, we can do:
```java
Parent[] myParentArray = new Child[10];

public void addAnimals(Animal[] animals ) {
  animals [0] = new Animal();

  // If passed animal[] is of type Dog[] then we are adding a Cat object to a Dog[] array.
  animals [1] = new Cat();

  // If passed animal[] is of type Cat[] then we are adding a Dog object to a cat[] array.
  animals [1] = new Dog();
  }
  
public class callerClass() {
  Animal[] animalArray = new Animal[10];
  Cat[] catArray = new Cat[10];
  Dog[] dogArray = new Dog[10];

  addAnimals(animalArray); //Expected, no questions raised here. 
  addAnimals(catArray); //As Cat[] is a type of Animal[] so we may end up in adding a Cat in Dog Array.                                                
  addAnimals(dogArray); // As Dog[] is a type of Animal[] so if Cat[] is passed we may end up in adding a Dog in a //Cat array.
}
```
Again, this won't work for type-safe collections like ArrayList.

## Wildcard as solution to polymorphism
```java
<K extends T>	// T와 T의 자손 타입만 가능 (K는 들어오는 타입으로 지정 됨)
<K super T>	// T와 T의 부모(조상) 타입만 가능 (K는 들어오는 타입으로 지정 됨)
 
<? extends T>	// T와 T의 자손 타입만 가능
<? super T>	// T와 T의 부모(조상) 타입만 가능
<?>		// 모든 타입 가능. <? extends Object>랑 같은 의미
```
I mentioned a generic method taking a type parameter.

It is similar to that, but wildcard is a bit different.
```java
//remember the keyword "extends" means either extends OR implements
public void takeAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animlas){
    for(Animal a: animals){
        a.eat();
  }
  }
```

When you use a wildcard in your method argument, the compiler will
STOP you from doing anything that could hurt the list referenced by
the method parameter.

You can still call methods on the elements in the list, but you cannot
add elements to the list!

### Use method's generic type parameter
```java
public <T extends Animal> void takeAnimals(List<T> list){
    
  }
```

This method is not being utilised to its true capability yet.
But what if we changed this method to return a list, of all
animals we have vaccinated? We can declare that the list
that is returned has the **same generic typ** as the list passed
as parameter.

```java
public <T extends Animal> List<T> void takeAnimals(List<T> list){

}
```

When we call this method, we get the **same type back** as the
type that we put inside.

```java
List<Dog> dogs = List.of(new Dog(), new Dog());
List<Dog> vaccinatedDogs= takeAnimals(dogs);

List<Animal> animals = List.of(new Dog(), new Cat());
List<Animal> vaccinatedAnimals= takeAnimals(animals);
```

### Wildcard for BOTH method parameter and return type
There is no guarantee method parameter and return type is of the
same type. Actually, anything calling this method has no idea what
is inside that collection, other than knowing it is subclass of Animal.

```java
public void go(){
  List<Dog> dogs = List.of(new Dog(), new Dog());
  List<? extends Animal> vaccinatedSomeStuff = takeAnimals(dogs);
  }
public List<? extends Animal> takeAnimals(List<? extends Animal> animals){
    
  }
```

### Difference between wildcard(?) and type parameter(T)
> Using the wildcard (“? extends”) is fine when you don’t care much about the generic type, you just
want to allow allsubtypes of some type.
> 
> Using a type parameter (“T”) is more helpful when you want to do more with the type itself, for
example in the method’s **return** like List<Animal> vaccinatedAnimals

## Summary
>A generic class means that the class declaration includes a type parameter.
> 
>A generic method means that the method declaration uses a type parameter
in its signature
