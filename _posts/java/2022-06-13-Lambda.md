## Intro
With interfaces like Comparator, we only have to implement a **single
abstract method**, SAM for short. These interfaces are so important that they
have several special names:

SAM Interfaces a.k.a. Functional Interfaces

If an interface has only one method that needs to be implemented, that
interface can be implemented as a lambda expression. You don’t need to
create a whole class to implement the interface; the compiler knows what the
class and method would look like. What the compiler doesn’t know is the
logic that goes inside that method.

**Lambda implements Comparator**
