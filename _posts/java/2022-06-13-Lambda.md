## Intro
With interfaces like Comparator, we only have to implement a **single
abstract method**, SAM for short. These interfaces are so important that they
have several special names:

SAM Interfaces a.k.a. Functional Interfaces

If an interface has only one method that needs to be implemented, that
interface can be implemented as a lambda expression. You don’t need to
create a whole class to implement the interface; the compiler knows what the
class and method would look like. What the compiler doesn’t know is the
logic that goes inside that method.

**Lambda implements Comparator**

## forEach() from Iterable interface
Remember List implements Iterable so it has this forEach() method,
which takes a lambda expression. It is a way to pass a *behaviour*
(follow these instructions) into a method, instead of passing
an object containing data("here is an object to be used") like for loop.

Using a method like forEach takes care of the “boilerplate,” the repetitive
and common code like the for loop. Using forEach, passing in only the thing
we want to do, can reduce accidental errors in our code.
