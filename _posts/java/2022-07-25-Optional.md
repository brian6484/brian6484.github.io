## Intro
Some operations may or may not return anything at all. To deal
with this issue, use Optional!

## Optional is a wrapper
Optional *wraps* the result so we can ask if that result is actually
present or empty (null).

Optional objects need to be asked if they *conain something* before
you **unwrap** them. Otherwise, you will get an exception if there
is no result.

```java
Optional<IceCream> optional = getIceCream("strawberry")
if(optional.isPresent()){
    IceCream ice = optional.get();
  }
```
In the past, methods might have thrown Exceptions for this case, or return
“null”, or a special type of “Not Found” ice-cream instance. Returning an
Optional from a method makes it really clear that anything calling the method
**needs** to check if there’s a result first, and **then** make their own decision
about what to do if there isn’t one.

## Optional with Stream
```java
Optional<Song> result = songs.stream()
  .filter(song -> song.getArtist().equals(artist))
  .findFirst();
if(result.isPresent()){
    //unwrap result
    System.out.println(result.get().getTitle());
  }
else{
    System.out.println("no songs");
  }
```
