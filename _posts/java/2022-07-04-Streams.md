## Intro
T is usually the Type of the object in the stream.
R is usually the type of the Result of the method.

## How to use Stream?
To use the Streams methods, we need a Stream object (obviously). If we
have a collection like a List, this doesn’t implement Stream. However, the
Collection interface has a method, stream(), which returns a Stream object
for the Collection.

```java
List<String> strings = List.of("hey","bitch");

//call stream() to get a stream of these Strings
Stream<String> stream = strings.stream();

//limit() gives up to maximum 4 elements
Stream<String> limit = stream.limit(4);
```

The limit() method returns another Stream of Strings, which we
assigned to a variable called limit.

Btw, if we try printing out this variable limit, we don't get the
elements in that list, we get this weird SliceOps things.

Like everything in Java, the stream variables in the example are Objects. But
a stream does **not** contain the elements in the collection. It’s more like the set
of instructions for the operations to perform on the Collection data

> Stream methods that return another Stream are called Intermediate Operations. These are
instructions of things to do, but they don’t actually perform the operation on their own.

## How to see result of using Stream's methods?
Stream is an instruction, like A recipe in a book only tells someone how to cook or bake something.
Opening the recipe doesn’t automatically present you with a freshly baked
chocolate cake. You need to gather the ingredients according to the recipe
and follow the instructions exactly to come up with the result you want.

To get that cake, we need to call a "do it". This "do it" method is called
**Terminary Operation** which actually returns something to you
unlike Intermediary Operations.

An example of terminary operation is Stream's .count() method
```java
//call stream() to get a stream of these Strings
Stream<String> stream = strings.stream();

//limit() gives up to maximum 4 elements
Stream<String> limit = stream.limit(4);

long result = limit.count();
System.out.println(result);
// outputs 4
```

This works but not that useful. One of the most common things to do
with Streams is put the results into another type of collection. The API
documentation for this method might seem intimidating with all the generic
types, but the simplest case is straightforward.
