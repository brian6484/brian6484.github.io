<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
Hello peeps! My name is Brian and I graduated from Imperial College London with a Master's degree in Computational Biomedical
  Engineering. I realised my interest and passion for programming during my university years and thus,
  I am now a Software Engineer, specialising in server/back-end development. :)
